Explanation:
Install Required Libraries: The script starts by ensuring that psutil is installed, which is essential for process management.
Monitor System: This function integrates multiple checks to detect anomalies in the system:
Anomaly Detection: Uses a trained model (clf) to predict if current data indicates an anomaly.
Isolate and Shutdown Rogue Processes: Identifies and isolates rogue processes, then shuts them down.
Critical Files and Thresholds:
Defines critical system files and thresholds for network connections, file access, and memory usage.
Essential Processes for System Lockdown: Lists essential processes that should not be terminated during a lockdown.
Monitor Email and Attachments:
Scans emails for attachments, particularly those with suspicious subjects like 'invoice' or 'payment'.
Saves non-text files to a specified directory and runs a virus scan on them.
Monitor Network Ports:
Scans all open ports on the system.
Checks for backdoors by identifying common backdoor ports (21, 22, 80, 443, 3389) and isolates processes using these ports.
Main Function Loop
The main function runs in a loop to continuously monitor the system:

Detect Anomalies: Uses the clf model to detect anomalies.
Isolate and Shutdown Rogue Processes: Identifies rogue processes and takes action to isolate and terminate them.
Scan Open Ports: Continuously scans for open ports and checks for backdoors.
Monitor Email and Attachments: Fetches emails, scans attachments, and runs virus scans on non-text files.
Sleep Interval
The loop sleeps for 60 seconds between each check to reduce CPU usage while maintaining a reasonable frequency of monitoring.
