Explanation:
Device Detection:

list_usb_devices(): This function uses pyusb to list all connected USB devices, printing their product name, vendor ID, and product ID.
CUDA Core Detection:

detect_cuda_gpus(): This function initializes the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) using pynvml to detect CUDA-capable GPUs. It returns a list of tuples containing the GPU index, name, and UUID.
Check CUDA on USB:

check_cuda_on_usb(cuda_gpus): This function cross-references the detected CUDA-capable GPUs with the list of USB devices to identify which GPUs are connected via USB.
Utilization:

use_cuda_cores(cuda_on_usb): This function uses PyTorch to perform a simple matrix multiplication on each detected CUDA core. It ensures that only available GPUs are used for computation.
Running the Script
To run this script, save it as a Python file (e.g., cuda_usb_scanner.py) and execute it:

python cuda_usb_scanner.py

This script will list all connected USB devices, detect CUDA-capable GPUs, check if these GPUs are connected via USB, and then perform a simple computational task using the detected CUDA cores.
