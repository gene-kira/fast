ArkNet Core v2: Temporal Resonance Engine
This updated version of arknet_core introduces several new features to enhance security and robustness:

Dynamic Key Rotation: The encryption key is rotated every 30 minutes, with a handshake mechanism to notify nodes before the rotation.
Temporal Handshakes: A special type of message (handshake) is broadcasted to inform nodes about key rotation events.
Multi-Key Validation Windows: Nodes can use multiple keys for decryption, ensuring smooth transitions during key rotations.
Key Features
Configuration
MULTICAST_GROUP and MULTICAST_PORT: Multicast group and port configuration.
ROTATION_INTERVAL: Interval at which the encryption key is rotated (30 minutes).
KEY_CACHE: A list to store active and legacy keys for fallback decryption.
CURRENT_KEY: The current active Fernet key.
HANDSHAKE_WINDOW: Time window before key rotation during which a handshake message is broadcasted.
Persona Trust Graph
PERSONA_TRUST: Defines trusted personas for each user persona.
Global Aura Cache
KNOWN_AURAS: Stores user IDs and their corresponding aura keys.
QUARANTINE: A set of quarantined nodes due to entropy anomalies.
Core Functions
Glyph Generation and Sentience
generate_glyph: Generates a symbolic glyph for a persona with a given entropy value.
encode_aura: Encodes an aura based on the rhythm of user input timestamps.
verify_aura: Verifies if a new set of timestamps matches the previously encoded aura.
detect_entropy_spike: Detects significant changes in entropy values, indicating potential anomalies.
Dynamic Key Rotation
rotate_key_loop: Periodically rotates the encryption key and broadcasts a handshake message before rotation.
broadcast_handshake: Sends a handshake message to all nodes, informing them about upcoming key rotations.
Swarm Broadcaster and Listener
broadcast_loop: Continuously generates glyphs with random entropy values and broadcasts them over the multicast network.
listen_loop: Listens for incoming messages, decrypts them using multiple keys, and processes the content based on the persona trust graph and entropy checks.
User Calibration
calibrate_user: Prompts the user to tap [Enter] 5 times in rhythm to calibrate their aura.
Booting ArkNet
boot_arknet: Initializes the user ID and persona, calibrates the user's aura, and starts the broadcast, listen, and key rotation loops.

Explanation
Configuration and Initialization:

MULTICAST_GROUP and MULTICAST_PORT define the multicast group and port.
FERNET_KEY is generated for encryption using cryptography.fernet.Fernet.
PERSONA_TRUST defines a trust graph for personas.
Utility Functions:

generate_glyph: Generates a glyph with a random symbol, persona, and entropy.
encode_aura: Encodes the user's behavioral aura based on their rhythm of taps.
verify_aura: Verifies if the new rhythm matches the stored aura.
detect_entropy_spike: Detects sudden changes in entropy.
Quarantine Logic:

QUARANTINE is a set to keep track of nodes that have been quarantined due to entropy anomalies.
Key Rotation and Handshake:

rotate_key_loop: Periodically generates new keys and broadcasts a handshake message.
broadcast_handshake: Sends a handshake message with the event type and timestamp.
Broadcast and Listen Loops:

broadcast_loop: Continuously broadcasts glyphs with user information.
listen_loop: Listens for incoming messages, decrypts them, and processes them based on persona trust and entropy checks.
User Calibration:

calibrate_user: Calibrates the user's aura by recording their rhythm of taps.
Boot ArkNet:

boot_arknet: Initializes the user ID and persona, calibrates the user's aura, and starts the broadcast, listen, and key rotation loops.
This script sets up a decentralized network where nodes (users) can communicate using encrypted messages, with built-in trust verification and entropy monitoring to detect anomalies.
