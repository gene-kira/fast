Explanation
Autoloader: This function ensures that all necessary libraries are loaded, including pyzmail for email handling, requests, BeautifulSoup, and deque for web scraping, watchdog for file system monitoring, and tensorflow for machine learning.

Machine Learning Model:

Model Architecture: A simple neural network with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
Training: Train the model using a dataset of feature vectors and labels. This is a placeholder step, and you need to implement feature extraction based on your requirements.
Saving the Model: Save the trained model for later use.
Load Trained Model:

Load the previously trained machine learning model from disk.
Preprocess Data:

Extract features from the file to be used as input for the machine learning model. This function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented based on your feature extraction method (e.g., using static analysis, dynamic analysis, or a combination of both).
Scan Email Attachments:

Read and parse the email.
Extract attachments and save them temporarily.
Preprocess each attachment and predict its threat level using the machine learning model.
Take appropriate action based on the prediction.
Monitor and Scan Downloaded Files:

Use watchdog to monitor the download directory for new files.
For each new file, preprocess it and predict its threat level using the machine learning model.
Take appropriate action based on the prediction.
Take Action:

Based on the prediction from the machine learning model, either quarantine or delete the file.
This script integrates all necessary components to provide a comprehensive solution for scanning email attachments and downloaded files for threats and rogue software, using both traditional methods and machine learning for enhanced detection.
