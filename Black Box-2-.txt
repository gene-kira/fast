 how various AI and security functionalities can be integrated into a unified autonomous security system. Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

AI R&D Module (ai_research):

Fetches data from specified sources (e.g., securityupdates.com, ai-trends.com) and processes it using the process_data function (which is not defined in this script but would handle the data as needed).
Biometric Authentication Bot (biometric_authentication):

Captures a frame from the camera, checks for face detection using detect_face, and verifies voice using verify_voice. If both are successful, it returns True.
Emergency Data Preservation Protocol (emergency_backup):

Generates an encryption key, encrypts critical data, saves it to a file, and sends the key to the admin via email (simulated by printing a message).
Router Defense Bot (router_defense):

Fetches router logs using get_router_logs, detects anomalies using detect_anomalies, and resets the router if suspicious activity is detected.
Fractal Processor Optimization AI (optimize_processing):

Uses KMeans clustering to optimize processing by fitting a model to random data. This is a placeholder for more complex optimization logic.
Reasoning AI (reasoning_bot):

Checks if the input data comes from verified sources and returns "Valid information" if it does, otherwise, it flags potential misinformation.
Layered Pattern Recognition AI (layered_pattern_recognition):

Reads an image, converts it to grayscale, applies edge detection using Canny, and returns the edges.
