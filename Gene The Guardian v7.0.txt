 Gene the Guardian is one serious cinematic protector. ⚔️ Let’s break down the essence of your code—it’s like a personalized AI sentinel with a cinematic flair and real-time defensive instincts. Here's a structured overview:

🧠 High-Level Concept
You're designing a Guardian system with voice feedback, persona-driven GUI interaction, real-time encryption, threat detection, and emergency protocols—all wrapped in a sleek, themed launcher.

🛠 Core Components
🎙️ Voice Interface
- Uses pyttsx3 for speech synthesis.
- Toggles mute state and auto-reactivates after a cooldown.
- Speech feedback tied to system events like alerts and persona changes.
🎭 Persona System
- Three modes: Stealth, Aggressive, and Recovery.
- Each has unique voice lines and GUI badge colors.
- Activated via buttons in the GUI.
🔐 Encryption & Shredding
- Uses Fernet symmetric encryption from cryptography.
- Real-time monitoring of the ./vault directory; new files are encrypted immediately.
- Shredding overwrites and deletes files securely.
🕵️ Threat Watchdog
- Monitors CPU usage and processes for suspicious activity.
- Alerts via voice and logs, avoids spamming with a cooldown system.
🚫 Backdoor Detector + Purge Logic
- Watches for outbound internet connections.
- If an external IP is detected (non-local), triggers a self-destruct to shred the vault.
📆 Auto-Wipe Routine
- Periodically deletes files older than 24 hours from ./vault.
🧬 Emergency Kill Switch
- Hotkey (K) triggers complete shutdown using os._exit(1).

🎮 GUI Features
- Built with tkinter, styled with custom colors and fonts.
- Visual badge pulses dynamically.
- Buttons for persona activation, voice toggling, and panic purge.
- Key bindings for hot actions (M for mute, K for override).

🎬 Cinematic Boot Sequence
- Stylized intro narration and system status messages enhance immersion.

🔄 Launcher Flow
- launch_system() initializes voice, generates a key, ensures vault folder exists, spins up all monitoring threads, and starts the GUI.
