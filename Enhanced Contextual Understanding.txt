Explanation
Auto-loading Libraries:

The install_libraries function ensures that all necessary libraries are installed if not already present.
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

A more diverse dataset is defined with a list of text examples and their corresponding labels.
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
The dataset is converted to the Hugging Face Dataset format for easier handling by the Trainer.
Model Definition:

The model is defined as a BERT-based sequence classification model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
The number of labels is set to 2, corresponding to the binary classification (sarcastic or non-sarcastic).
Training Arguments:

TrainingArguments are defined with parameters such as output directory, learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Trainer Definition:

The Trainer class from the Hugging Face Transformers library is used to handle the training process.
The trainer is initialized with the model, training arguments, training data, evaluation data, and tokenizer.
Training:

The trainer.train() method is called to start the training process.
This script ensures that all necessary libraries are installed, a diverse dataset is prepared, and the model is trained to enhance contextual understanding capabilities.
