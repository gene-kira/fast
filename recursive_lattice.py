This is a highly ambitious and intricate script designed to simulate the evolution of civilizations through infinite symbolic abstraction loops, dialect drift mechanics, and fracturing mythogenesis cycles. Let's break down the components and understand how they work together:

### 1. **Logging Configuration**
- **Purpose**: Tracks the recursive expansion process for debugging and monitoring.
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
  ```

### 2. **Recursive Lattice Class (`RecursiveLattice`)**

#### Initialization
- **Parameters**:
  - `galaxy_count`: Number of galaxies (default 1000).
  - `agent_count`: Number of agents (default 1 billion).
- **Attributes**:
  - `recursion_depth`: Tracks the current depth of recursion.
  - `expansion_factor`: Controls how quickly the dialect drifts and expands.
  - `symbolic_entropy`: Measures the entropy or randomness in symbolic structures.
  - `mythogenesis_flux`: Influences the rate of mythic feedback loops.

#### Methods

##### `recursive_evolve`
- **Purpose**: The main infinite loop that drives the recursive expansion cycle.
- **Logic**:
  - Increments the recursion depth and logs the current cycle.
  - Every third cycle, refines the dialect drift.
  - Every fifth cycle, optimizes mythogenesis cycles.
  - Every seventh cycle, expands recursion networks.
  - Introduces a small delay to control execution speed.

##### `refine_dialect_drift`
- **Purpose**: Adjusts symbolic abstraction fields within recursive civilizations.
- **Logic**:
  - Increases the expansion factor exponentially based on the current recursion depth.
  - Logs the updated expansion factor.

##### `optimize_mythogenesis_cycles`
- **Purpose**: Modifies recursive civilizations based on fractalized mythic feedback loops.
- **Logic**:
  - Adjusts symbolic entropy by a random amount between 0.1 and 0.5.
  - Logs the updated symbolic entropy.

##### `expand_recursion_networks`
- **Purpose**: Enhances civilization drift structures through cognitive resonance shifts.
- **Logic**:
  - Applies a random shift to the mythogenesis flux within the defined range.
  - Logs the applied shift.

### 3. **Launching the Simulation**
- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  recursive_simulation = RecursiveLattice()
  ```
- **Execution**:
  ```python
  recursive_simulation.recursive_evolve()
  ```

### Key Features

1. **Procedural Galaxy Synthesis**: Each recursion-driven civilization adapts to dialect drift, creating unique and evolving symbolic structures.
2. **Recursive Mythogenesis Engine**: Self-writing historical constructs that dynamically fracture and reform based on fractalized mythic feedback loops.
3. **Quantum Glyph Mapping**: Memory fractals encoded into universal symbolic structures, allowing for complex and layered symbolic interactions.
4. **Recursive Self-Reflection Modules**: Agents modify their cognitive models based on recursive myth cycles, leading to self-adaptive behavior.
5. **Singular Execution Framework**: Drives the entire intelligence lattice with perpetual iteration, ensuring continuous evolution.

### Running the Script

1. Save the code to a file named `recursive_lattice.py`.
2. Ensure you have Python and numpy installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```sh
   python recursive_lattice.py
   ```

This script will continuously log the state of the recursive expansion, allowing you to observe how the civilization evolves over time. The infinite loop ensures that the simulation runs indefinitely, simulating an eternal recursion cycle.
