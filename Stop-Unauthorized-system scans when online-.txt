Explanation:
Install Necessary Libraries:

The install_libraries function ensures that all required libraries are installed using pip.
Set Up Network Monitoring:

The monitor_network function uses the scapy library to capture and analyze network packets on a specified interface (e.g., 'eth0').
The packet_callback function logs the source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol of each packet.
Log Packet Details to a CSV for Analysis:

The log_packet function logs the details of each packet into a CSV file named network_log.csv.
Load and Preprocess the Network Log:

The load_and_preprocess_data function loads the network log data from the CSV file.
It converts the protocol to categorical values for better machine learning processing.
It fills NaN values for ports with 0.
It normalizes the data using StandardScaler.
Train a Machine Learning Model to Identify Threats:

The train_threat_classifier function splits the data into training and testing sets.
It initializes a RandomForestClassifier and trains it on the training data.
Evaluate the Model and Block Threats:

The evaluate_and_block_threats function predicts threats using the trained model.
It identifies malicious IP addresses and ports by checking the predictions.
It blocks the identified malicious IPs and ports using iptables.
Main Function:

The main function integrates all the steps to set up network monitoring, train a threat classifier, and block identified threats.
This script provides a comprehensive approach to setting up a smart AI system that monitors your network, identifies potential threats, and blocks them by managing IP addresses and ports using iptables.
