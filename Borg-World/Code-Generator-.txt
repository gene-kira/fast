Explanation
Initialization:

The CodeGenerator class is initialized with an optimizer that can be used to predict and apply optimizations.
The optimization_rules dictionary contains flags for different types of optimizations, such as reducing network calls, minimizing memory usage, and parallelizing operations.
Prediction:

The predict_optimization method uses abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis to determine if the code can be optimized based on the specified rules.
It checks if the code contains network send calls and large lists that can be optimized.
Optimization:

The generate_optimized_code method applies the predicted optimizations to the original code using an AST transformer.
Auto Loader for Necessary Libraries:

Extract existing imports from the original code.
Add necessary libraries such as socket, concurrent.futures, and ast.
Reduce Network Calls:

This optimization reduces the number of network calls by batching them together.
It replaces individual send calls with a batched version, which can be more efficient for bulk operations.
Minimize Memory Usage:

This optimization minimizes memory usage by replacing large lists with generators for lazy evaluation.
Large lists (more than 100 elements) are transformed into generator expressions to reduce memory footprint.
Parallelize Operations:

This optimization parallelizes for loops using concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to execute tasks in parallel, which can significantly speed up operations that can be run concurrently
