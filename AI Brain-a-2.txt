Explanation
AI_Brain Class: This class defines the neural network architecture for processing visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric data.
Data Collection and Preprocessing: The collect_and_preprocess_data function collects and preprocesses visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric data.
Reinforcement Learning Function: The reinforce_model function updates the model based on rewards.
Voice Interaction: The voice_interaction function uses speech recognition and synthesis to interact with the user.
Real-Time Processing Loop: The real_time_processing function processes data in real-time and performs actions based on the decision output.
GUI: A simple GUI using tkinter is created to start the real-time processing loop.
This script integrates all the additional features you mentioned, providing a comprehensive system for interacting with an AI model that processes multiple types of sensor data
