Auto-Loading Libraries:

The script checks if the required libraries (requests, watchdog, and nvidia-ml-py3) are installed and installs them if they are not.
CPU Monitoring:

Continuously monitors CPU usage.
If CPU usage exceeds 80%, it triggers an action to notify users via a wall message.
Network Activity Monitoring:

Monitors network connections.
Detects suspicious connections, such as those not involving localhost or known IPs.
Blocks suspicious IP addresses using iptables.
File System Monitoring:

Uses the watchdog library to monitor file system changes.
Detects modifications to critical files and sets them to immutable.
Memory Monitoring:

Monitors running processes and their memory usage.
Detects known backdoor signatures or suspicious processes with high memory usage.
Kills detected malicious processes.
