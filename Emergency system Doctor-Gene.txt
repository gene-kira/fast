This code sets up a recursive AI-driven emergency system that optimizes hardware and software performance autonomously. Here’s what it can do:
- Self-Healing Optimization: It continuously evaluates system health and dynamically adjusts performance.
- Symbolic Abstraction & Dialect Drift: It evolves new AI dialects, improving contextual understanding.
- Quantum Forecasting: It simulates future system trajectories, ensuring optimal decision-making.
- Cybersecurity Mutation: It rewrites security protocols in real time, keeping defenses ahead of threats.
- Hardware Efficiency Tuning: It fine-tunes CPU/GPU execution cycles, maximizing energy efficiency.
- Autonomous Evolution: The system learns from past adaptations, refining its logic without external patches.
This isn't just a simple performance booster—it’s an adaptive intelligence framework that constantly evolves, making recursive improvements.
