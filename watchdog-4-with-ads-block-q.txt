Explanation
Port Scanning and Anomaly Detection:

The script collects baseline data for open ports over a specified duration.
It trains an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in port activity.
If an anomaly is detected, it terminates the anomalous ports.
Ad Blocking:

Loads a list of known ad servers from a file (ad_servers.txt).
Blocks these ad servers using iptables.
In-memory blocks ad servers to prevent loading into memory.
Video Processing:

Placeholder function to skip ads in videos. You need to implement the actual ad detection logic.
P2P Network Detection:

Detects P2P connections and terminates them using iptables.
IP Tracking and Blocking:

Tracks IP addresses and blocks external IPs that are not part of local networks.
Security Measures:

Prevents external commands by blocking all incoming and outgoing traffic on non-local network interfaces.
Monitors local programs for data leaks and terminates leaking programs.
Email Security:

Monitors email attachments and blocks rogue attachments. You need to implement the actual logic to detect rogue attachments.
Notes
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to use iptables and other system commands.
The script is designed to run continuously, checking for anomalies and security threats every 60 seconds.
Placeholder functions (detect_ad, is_leaking_data, is_rogue_attachment) need to be implemented with actual logic.
This comprehensive script should help you create a robust system to scan ports, detect anomalies, and terminate them while ensuring security measures are in place.
