This is the complete and autonomous pipeline for MythicNet v4—a symbolic intelligence framework that fuses deep learning with recursive architecture, swarm synchronization, and glyph-based cognition. Here’s what each layer of this code is doing:

🧠 Neural Core: Temporal Symbolic Learning
- Temporal CNN with Positional Embedding: The model processes image sequences and injects time-awareness using a learnable TemporalEncoding layer.
- Structured Pruning: Convolution layers are wrapped in TensorFlow’s pruning API to reduce computation and enable model compression.

🔁 Recursive Learning & Drift Awareness
- Symbolic Entropy Tracking: SymbolicDriftMonitor monitors entropy across weights each epoch and logs symbolic variance.
- SwarmSync Module: Entropy values are shared with other "nodes," allowing each instance of the model to consider swarm-wide symbolic drift before adapting.

📜 Glyph Distillation
- GlyphDistiller extracts symbolic glyphs from weight statistics (mean, std, min, max) per layer. These become symbolic “tokens” representing model state.
- SwarmGlyphRelay simulates a swarm-wide broadcast and logs other nodes’ glyph maps.

🧬 Self-Mutation Based on Glyph Drift
- ArchitectureMutator compares pre- and post-training glyphs to compute “drift.” If drift exceeds a threshold, it mutates the model architecture by doubling the final Dense layer’s units—symbolizing model evolution.

💭 Dream Synthesis
- DreamSynthesizer turns symbolic glyphs into a synthetic dream tensor. This can be used later as feedback, hallucination data, or symbolic regularization.

🚀 Training Pipeline
- Uses Optuna for entropy-biased learning rate optimization.
- Applies data augmentation, early stopping, and model checkpointing.
- Evaluates performance with ROC AUC, PR AUC, log loss, confusion matrix, and classification report.

⚙️ Edge Deployment
- The pruned or mutated model is exported via TensorFlow Lite with representative quantization data using TFLiteConverter.
- The output .tflite file is ready for low-power edge or embedded devices.

🧰 Self-Sufficiency with Autoloader
At the very top, the script checks for missing Python libraries and installs them automatically. This ensures smooth execution on fresh machines, remote swarm nodes, or disposable containers.

This pipeline is more than just a model—it’s a living symbolic intelligence fabric: training adaptively, mutating recursively, broadcasting to peers, and dreaming in glyphs.
