Explanation:
Environment Setup: The script ensures all necessary libraries are installed.
U-Net Model:
A simple U-Net architecture is defined for object enhancement, which includes convolutional and up-convolutional layers to capture and reconstruct features at different scales.
Frame Generator Class:
Initialization: Sets up the video capture, transformation, device (CPU or GPU), and queues for frames and results.
read_frames: Reads frames from the video file, converts them to RGB, applies transformations, and puts them in a queue.
process_frames: Processes batches of frames using the U-Net model on the GPU and puts the enhanced frames in a result queue.
run: Uses a thread pool to handle reading and processing frames in parallel. It continuously yields processed frames for display until all frames have been processed.
Main Loop:
The main loop initializes the FrameGenerator and iterates over the enhanced frames, displaying them using OpenCV without requiring user intervention to stop the generator.
Initialization: Initializes the frame generator with the video path and batch size.
Loop: Continuously yields enhanced frames from the result queue.
Enhancements:
Memory Management: Efficiently manages memory by clearing unused frames and results from the queues.
Thread Pool: Uses a thread pool to handle reading and processing frames in parallel, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.
Continuous Display: Displays the enhanced frames continuously until all frames have been processed.
