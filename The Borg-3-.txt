Explanation of the Integration
Data Loading and Splitting:

The load_data function reads a CSV file, splits it into training and validation sets using an 80/20 split.
Anomaly Detection:

The detect_anomalies function calculates Z-scores to identify outliers in the data. It returns a boolean series indicating which rows are anomalies.
The handle_anomalies function removes the detected anomalies from the training data.
Data Augmentation:

The augment_data function adds Gaussian noise to the training data multiple times (5 by default) to create augmented datasets. This helps in improving the robustness of the model.
Model Creation and Training with Hyperparameter Tuning:

The create_model function defines a simple neural network with one hidden layer. It uses hyperparameters for the number of units and learning rate, which are suggested by Optuna.
The train_meta_model_with_tuning function sets up an Optuna study to perform hyperparameter tuning. It optimizes the model using validation loss as the objective.
Model Conversion to TFLite:

The convert_to_tflite function converts the trained Keras model to a TFLite model optimized for Edge TPU.
A representative dataset is provided to ensure that the quantization process is accurate.
Evaluation with Edge TPU:

The run_tflite_model function uses the TFLite interpreter to run predictions on the validation set and calculates the accuracy of the model.
Main Function
The main function ties all these components together, ensuring that each step is executed in sequence. It starts by loading the data, handling anomalies, augmenting the training data, creating and tuning the model, converting it to TFLite, and finally evaluating the model's performance on a Coral USB Accelerator.
Logging
The script uses logging to provide informative output about each step of the process, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring the progress of the script.
