This script integrates various components to create a comprehensive AI bot that can monitor system processes, detect anomalies, and ensure its own survival. It leverages the provided citations to implement robust monitoring, anomaly detection, and self-preservation mechanisms.

Key Components:
Initialization and Logging:

Sets up logging for tracking the AI bot's activities.
Installs necessary libraries using pip.
Critical Files and Thresholds:

Defines critical files that should be protected on both Unix-like and Windows systems.
Sets thresholds for network connections, file access, and memory usage.
Process Management:

Terminates processes by name to ensure only trusted processes run.
Monitors and terminates new processes that are not in the trusted list.
Anomaly Detection:

Trains an anomaly detector using Isolation Forest from scikit-learn.
Continuously monitors system behavior for anomalies.
Network Monitoring:

Blocks unauthorized IP addresses by adding rules to iptables.
Data Leak Prevention:

Secures sensitive data files by changing their permissions.
Process Exploration and Blocking (PEB):

Monitors new processes and terminates those that are not trusted.
Kernel Module Monitoring:

Removes unauthorized kernel modules from the system.
Camera and Microphone Access:

Terminates processes accessing camera or microphone to prevent unauthorized access.
User Interaction:

Provides a user interface for interacting with the AI bot.
Generates responses using an NLP pipeline.
Handles specific problems with rule-based solutions.
Offloads complex computations to a secondary module for performance optimization.
Main Script Flow
Initialization and Library Installation:

Installs necessary libraries using pip.
Initializes logging for tracking the AI bot's activities.
Collect Historical Data:

Collects historical data for training the anomaly detector.
Train Anomaly Detector:

Trains an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in system behavior.
Initialize Environment and Threads:

Initializes the environment with a secondary module IP.
Starts threads for monitoring network connections, data leaks, camera/microphone access, process exploration, and kernel modules.
Main Loop:

Periodically checks processes running under nt-authority\system and terminates unauthorized ones.
Continuously monitors system behavior using the trained anomaly detector.
Provides a user interface for interaction with the AI bot.
Generates responses to user queries using an NLP pipeline.
Handles specific problems with rule-based solutions.
Offloads complex computations to a secondary module for performance optimization.
This script ensures that the AI bot is capable of monitoring and maintaining system integrity, detecting anomalies, and ensuring its own survival while interacting with users effectively.
