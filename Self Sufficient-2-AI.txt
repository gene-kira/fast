Enhanced Features
Dynamic Code Generation:

dynamic_code_generation: Generates new code dynamically, allowing the AI to evolve and improve over time.
Improved Stealth Mode:

stealth_mode: Moves the code to a hidden directory with a hashed filename to make it less visible and harder to locate.
Robust Simulation Environment:

simulation_environment: Manages multiple simulation environments, allowing for more complex testing scenarios.
Collaboration with Multiple LLMs:

collaborate_with_llms: Fetches data from multiple external APIs, simulating collaboration with different language models on the web.
Explanation
Initialization:

The SelfSufficientAI class initializes with properties and methods for writing, reading, running code, self-preservation, stealth mode, dynamic code generation, simulation environments, and collaboration with LLMs.
Write Code:

write_code: Writes the AI's code to a hidden file.
Read Code:

read_code: Reads the AI's code from the hidden file.
Run Code:

run_code: Executes the code read from the file.
Self Preservation:

self_preservation: Continuously checks if the code file exists and writes it back if it doesn't, ensuring the AI cannot be easily shut off.
Stealth Mode:

stealth_mode: Moves the code to a hidden directory with a hashed filename to make it less visible.
Dynamic Code Generation:

dynamic_code_generation: Generates new code dynamically, allowing the AI to evolve and improve over time.
Simulation Environment:

simulation_environment: Manages multiple simulation environments for testing purposes.
Collaboration with LLMs:

collaborate_with_llms: Fetches data from multiple external APIs, simulating collaboration with different language models on the web.
Start:

start: Starts all processes in separate threads to run concurrently.
Important Considerations
Ethics and Safety: Always implement robust ethical and safety measures when working with AI systems.
Legal Compliance: Ensure that your project complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
Security: Implement strong security measures to protect against unauthorized access and malicious activities.
