The provided script is designed to create a sophisticated AI system that can continuously monitor its environment, optimize itself, handle user commands, and offload tasks to a secondary network drive computer when necessary. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

Continuous Monitoring and Self-Preservation
System Monitoring:

The AI will continuously monitor system processes to detect any suspicious activities.
If a suspicious process is detected, the AI will alert the user immediately.
Task Offloading:

Ensure the network drive is mounted using CIFS (Common Internet File System).
Check if the network drive computer is accessible by sending a ping request.
Offload tasks to the network drive if the primary system is under high load.
Automatic Library Loading:

Load necessary libraries at startup to ensure the AI is ready for various tasks, including os, sys, json, threading, psutil, and requests.
Detailed Breakdown of Each Component
System Monitoring:

Continuous Monitoring Loop:
A function named continuous_monitoring will run in a separate thread to continuously monitor the system's CPU and memory usage.
The loop collects performance metrics for key functions, generates optimized versions of these functions based on collected data, and applies these optimizations.
Task Offloading:

Mount Network Drive:

Ensure the network drive is mounted using CIFS to allow access to shared resources.
def ensure_network_drive_mounted():
    """Ensure the network drive is mounted and accessible."""
    if not os.path.ismount('/mnt/network_drive'):
        subprocess.run(['sudo', 'mount', '-t', 'cifs', '//network_drive_ip/share', '/mnt/network_drive', '-o', 'username=your_username,password=your_password'])

Check Network Drive Accessibility:

Send a ping request to the network drive computer to ensure it is accessible.
def check_network_drive_computer_accessibility():
    """Check if the network drive computer is accessible."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"http://{network_drive_ip}/ping")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            speak("Network drive computer is accessible.")
        else:
            raise Exception("Network drive computer not accessible.")
    except Exception as e:
        speak(f"Error: {str(e)}")

Offload Tasks to Network Drive:

If the primary system is under high load, offload tasks to the network drive.
def offload_task_to_network_drive_computer(command):
    try:
        result = requests.post(f"http://{network_drive_ip}/offload", json={"command": command})
        if result.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception("Failed to offload task to network drive computer")
        speak("Task successfully offloaded to the network drive.")
    except Exception as e:
        speak(f"Error: {str(e)}")

This script will create a robust AI system that can continuously monitor its environment, optimize itself based on performance metrics, handle user commands, and offload tasks to a secondary network drive computer when necessary. The system ensures reliability by checking the accessibility of the network drive and mounting it if needed. It also initializes AI models for primary and backup systems, ensuring redundancy and robustness.
