Explanation:
AI Brain Model: A PyTorch model that processes visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric inputs.
Visual Perception: Uses a TensorFlow model to process images.
Audio Perception: Uses a TensorFlow model to process audio files.
AISystem Class: Manages the overall AI system, including processing sensory data, reasoning, moving to target positions, learning from interactions, reflecting on capabilities, and updating emotional states.
Chat Interface: A simple text-based interface that allows users to interact with the AI by sending commands.
This setup provides a foundation for an interactive AI system that can process different types of sensor data and respond to user commands. You can expand this further by adding more sophisticated models, interfaces, and functionalities as needed.
