ðŸš€ Explanation
âœ” Recursive AI Model: Uses meta-learning to refine tensor harmonization dynamically.
âœ” Multi-Agent Collaboration: Synchronizes intelligence cycles across agents using decentralized governance.
âœ” Self-Healing Mechanisms: AI adjusts itself autonomously, preventing intelligence drift.
