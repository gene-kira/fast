This script integrates multimodal sensory processing, continuous learning, and system monitoring to create a comprehensive AI system. The AISystem class combines all components from the provided citations into a single cohesive structure. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how each part contributes:

Continuous Learning: This component allows the AI to adapt over time by updating its model with new data.
Sensory Data Processing:
Visual Perception: Processes images using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Audio Perception: Processes audio files and extracts MFCC features.
Tactile Perception: Processes tactile sensor data.
Reasoning:
Logical Reasoning: Uses predefined rules to make decisions based on input data.
Probabilistic Reasoning: Uses a probabilistic model to handle uncertainty in decision-making.
System Monitoring:
Anomaly Detection: Monitors system processes for anomalies using an Isolation Forest model.
Email Security: Fetches and scans emails for potential threats.
This comprehensive AI system can adapt, learn, and monitor its environment effectively
