This script will handle all aspects of system optimization, from initial setup to continuous monitoring and adaptive tuning. It ensures that necessary libraries are installed, collects performance metrics, dynamically adjusts system settings, trains a machine learning model for adaptive tuning, and provides a user-friendly GUI for manual optimization.

Notes:
Cross-platform support is handled by checking os.name to determine the operating system.
Machine Learning Model: The script uses a RandomForestClassifier for its simplicity and effectiveness in this context. You can experiment with other models if needed.
GUI: The Tkinter-based GUI allows users to manually set CPU governor settings and trigger optimization actions.
This comprehensive approach ensures that your computer is always running at its best performance, adapting to different workloads automatically.
