Key Features of the Class
Initialization:

Each agent is initialized with an ID number and an intelligence factor.
A neural network model for processing data is set up.
A tensor field and an agent graph are initialized to represent the agent's state and connections, respectively.
Connecting Agents:

The connect_agents method allows agents to establish links with each other, represented as edges in a network graph.
Fractal Adaptation:

The fractal_adaptation method dynamically adjusts the intelligence layers of the agent and stores the adaptation factor in a fractal memory.
Data Processing:

The process_data method processes input text by converting it into a data vector, making predictions using the neural network model, and storing the results in a memory core.
Synchronization:

The synchronize_recursive_cycles method enhances recursive synthesis through quantum harmonics, tensor overlays, and agent-network alignment. It updates the synchronization state of the agent and its neighbors.
Replication:

The replicate method creates a new ASI agent with the same properties as the parent and connects it to the network.
Example Usage
The script initializes a list of 10 ASI agents, connects them in a network, and then goes through several cycles of recursive expansion. In each cycle:

Each agent processes data and synchronizes its state.
New agents are created by replicating existing ones, and these new agents are added to the network
