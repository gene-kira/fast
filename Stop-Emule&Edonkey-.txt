Explanation
Library Installation:

The install_library function checks if the required libraries (scapy and psutil) are installed. If not, it installs them using pip.
Network Monitoring:

The sniff function from scapy is used to monitor UDP traffic on ports 4242 (eMule KAD) and 4662 (eDonkey P2P).
The packet_callback function processes each packet and checks if it matches the specified ports. If a match is found, it prints the details and calls find_process_by_port.
Process Management:

The find_process_by_port function iterates through all running processes and their connections to find any process using the specified port.
If a process is found, its PID is returned.
Termination and Removal:

The terminate_and_remove_program function terminates the identified process using psutil.
It then calls remove_program_files to delete the associated program files and directories.
File Operations:

The remove_program_files function deletes the specified program files and directories based on the program name.
It uses a dictionary to map program names to their respective file paths, which are expanded and removed if they exist.
This script ensures that all necessary libraries are installed, monitors network traffic for eMule KAD and eDonkey P2P, identifies and terminates the associated processes, and removes the program files
