Explanation
Initialization: The AI_Brain class initializes neural networks for different brain sections.
S-Bit Initialization: S-bits are initialized to represent the output of each neural network.
Processing Inputs: Each input (visual, auditory, tactile, biometric) is processed by its respective neural network and converted into S-bits.
Amygdala and Hippocampus: These sections process the S-bits from different inputs to produce emotional responses and memory recall.
Prefrontal Cortex: This section makes decisions based on the outputs of the amygdala and hippocampus.
GUI: A simple GUI is created using tkinter to start the real-time processing.
This example provides a conceptual framework for building a hybrid brain model using S-bit technology. The actual implementation would require more sophisticated models and error handling, but this should give you a starting point.
