Explanation
Install Libraries: The install_libraries function checks if the required libraries (psutil, pyaudio, and opencv-python) are installed and installs them if necessary.

Initialize Script: The initialize function clears the console and prints an initialization message.

Monitor Webcam:

Uses OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam.
If a frame is not captured successfully, it indicates unauthorized access, and the script kills a suspicious process (e.g., capstone.exe).
Monitor Microphone:

Uses PyAudio to open an input stream for the microphone.
If no data is received from the microphone, it indicates unauthorized access, and the script kills a suspicious process.
Monitor Processes:

Uses psutil to iterate over active processes.
Checks if the process name matches any known suspicious processes (e.g., malware.exe, rogue.exe, suspicious_program.exe).
Kills the detected suspicious process using a system command.
Main Function:

Starts all monitoring tasks in separate threads to ensure they run concurrently without blocking each other.
The main thread runs the process monitoring function.
This script ensures that your system remains secure by continuously monitoring for unauthorized access to your webcam and microphone, as well as detecting and terminating suspicious processes
