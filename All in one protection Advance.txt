The provided script is designed to create a comprehensive AI bot that continuously monitors your system for security threats, manages processes and network traffic, and updates its detection model regularly. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key components and how they work together:

Overview
Libraries:

psutil: For monitoring system processes and managing them.
scapy: For analyzing network traffic.
watchdog: For monitoring file system changes.
tensorflow: For machine learning model training.
flask: For creating a web-based user interface.
subprocess: For executing system commands.
Logging:

The script uses the logging module to log all actions and events for auditing and troubleshooting.
Real-time Monitoring:

Process Monitoring: Continuously scans system processes for CPU usage, memory usage, and suspicious names.
Network Monitoring: Captures network packets and identifies data leaks.
File System Monitoring: Watches for changes in the file system to detect malicious files.
Drive Protection: Ensures that no rogue programs can encrypt or format drives.
Port Management: Opens and closes ports as needed to protect against unauthorized access.
Machine Learning Model:

Trains a machine learning model to predict threats based on process features like CPU and memory usage.
Flask Web Interface:

Provides a user interface for monitoring current threats and system status.
Scheduled Updates:

The script schedules the machine learning model to be updated daily to adapt to new threats.
