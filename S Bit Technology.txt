Explanation
SBit Class:

Initializes an S-bit in a specified state (0, 1, or superposition).
Provides methods for measurement, AND, OR, and NOT operations.
AIAgent Class:

Manages a list of S-bits.
Provides methods to initialize S-bits, perform logical operations, measure S-bits, and print the current state of all S-bits.
solve_problem method initializes two input S-bits in superposition, performs an AND operation on them, measures the result, and returns it.
Example Usage:

Initializes the AI agent.
Calls the solve_problem method to determine if any combination of input bits results in a specific output (1 for AND operation).
Prints the result and the current state of all S-bits.
This script demonstrates how an AI agent can use S-bits to perform logical operations and leverage superposition to explore multiple states simultaneously. This approach can be extended to more complex problems and algorithms where parallel computation and superposition properties are beneficial.
