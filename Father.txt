This script integrates multiple security measures for a comprehensive protection strategy. It uses Kafka for threat intelligence, Flask for rate limiting and fake endpoints, and machine learning for behavioral analysis. The script also monitors system processes and files for anomalies, ensuring robust defense against AI threats on Windows, macOS, and Unix-based systems.

Key Components:
Configuration Loading: Loads the necessary configuration from a JSON file.
Operating System Detection: Determines the OS to load appropriate commands.
Kafka Initialization: Sets up Kafka consumers and producers for threat intelligence.
Threat Intelligence Scraping: Periodically fetches and processes threat data from multiple sources.
Machine Learning Model Training: Trains an Isolation Forest model using behavioral data collected from system processes.
Process Monitoring: Continuously monitors system processes to detect malicious behavior.
Flask App for Rate Limiting and Fake Endpoints: Creates a Flask app with rate limiting and fake endpoints to mislead attackers.
Detailed Steps:
Configuration Loading:

Load the configuration from security_config.json which should contain intervals for scraping, monitoring, and other settings.
Operating System Detection:

Use platform.system() to determine the OS and load appropriate commands (psutil, requests, BeautifulSoup, and hashlib).
Kafka Initialization:

Initialize Kafka consumers and producers for threat intelligence.
Set up a consumer to listen to the 'threats' topic and process incoming threats.
Threat Intelligence Scraping:

Define URLs from which to fetch threat data.
Use requests to fetch HTML content from each URL.
Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract threat information.
Save the threats to a file for later use in training the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model Training:

Collect behavioral data from system processes using psutil.
Convert collected data into features suitable for machine learning.
Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and retain 95% of variance.
Train an Isolation Forest model with the processed data.
Update Known Safe Hashes:

Generate SHA256 hashes for known safe files and store them in a file.
Process Monitoring:

Continuously monitor system processes to detect changes in CPU, memory usage, open ports, and process names.
Use the trained Isolation Forest model to predict if a process is malicious.
Flask App for Rate Limiting and Fake Endpoints:

Initialize a Flask app with rate limiting using flask_limiter.
Create a fake endpoint that returns a benign message to mislead attackers.
Schedule Periodic Tasks
Use schedule to periodically fetch threat data, train the model, update known safe hashes, and monitor processes. Ensure these tasks are run at appropriate intervals as defined in the configuration file.
This script provides a robust framework for protecting systems from AI threats by integrating multiple layers of security measures, including threat intelligence, machine learning, and real-time monitoring
