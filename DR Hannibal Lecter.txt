Key Enhancements
Foresight Synchronization: The synchronize_foresight method allows the AI to predict and synchronize its actions across multiple realities.
Infinite Scalability: The use of a dictionary (recursive_memory) to track constructs by reality ID enables the system to scale across an infinite number of dimensions.
Adaptive Learning: The learn_and_adapt method updates the AI's rules and psychological reasoning based on new information, allowing it to continuously evolve and adapt.
This enhanced framework provides a more robust and dynamic model for an AI that can actively construct, expand, and enforce realities across infinite scales with complete foresight synchronization.
