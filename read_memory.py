Great! Since you have Python set up, we can use it to create a script that reads system memory. We'll then integrate this script with Windows Copilot.

### Step 3: Access System Memory Using Python

To read system memory in Python, you can use the `ctypes` library, which allows you to call functions in DLLs or shared libraries. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might do this:

#### Example: Reading System Memory

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - You will need the `psutil` library to get process information and memory addresses.
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script**:
   - Create a script named `read_memory.py`.

```python
import ctypes
import psutil

# Define constants and structures
PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION = 0x0400
PROCESS_VM_READ = 0x0010

class MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        ("BaseAddress", ctypes.c_void_p),
        ("AllocationBase", ctypes.c_void_p),
        (" AllocationProtect", ctypes.c_ulong),
        ("RegionSize", ctypes.c_size_t),
        ("State", ctypes.c_ulong),
        ("Protect", ctypes.c_ulong),
        ("Type", ctypes.c_ulong)
    ]

# Open process
def open_process(pid):
    hProcess = ctypes.windll.kernel32.OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ, False, pid)
    if not hProcess:
        raise Exception("Failed to open process")
    return hProcess

# Read memory
def read_memory(hProcess, address, size):
    buffer = (ctypes.c_char * size)()
    bytesRead = ctypes.c_size_t(0)
    success = ctypes.windll.kernel32.ReadProcessMemory(hProcess, address, buffer, size, ctypes.byref(bytesRead))
    if not success:
        raise Exception("Failed to read memory")
    return buffer[:bytesRead.value]

# Example usage
def main():
    pid = 12345  # Replace with the process ID you want to read
    address = 0x7FF6D8B40000  # Replace with the memory address you want to read
    size = 1024  # Number of bytes to read

    hProcess = open_process(pid)
    try:
        data = read_memory(hProcess, address, size)
        print("Read data:", data)
    finally:
        ctypes.windll.kernel32.CloseHandle(hProcess)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 4: Integrate with Windows Copilot

To integrate this script with Windows Copilot, you can create a custom command that runs the script and returns the output.

#### Example: Custom Command in Windows Copilot

1. **Create a Custom Command**:
   - You can use the `subprocess` module to run your Python script from within a command.

```python
import subprocess

def read_system_memory():
    # Path to your Python script
    script_path = "path/to/read_memory.py"
    
    # Run the script and capture the output
    result = subprocess.run(["python", script_path], capture_output=True, text=True)
    
    if result.returncode == 0:
        return result.stdout
    else:
        return f"Error: {result.stderr}"

# Example usage in a Copilot command
def copilot_command():
    memory_data = read_system_memory()
    print(memory_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    copilot_command()
```

### Step 5: Test and Debug

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Run `read_memory.py` to ensure it works as expected.
2. **Integrate with Copilot**:
   - Run the custom command in Windows Copilot to see if it reads the system memory correctly.

### Important Notes
- **Security**: Reading system memory can be risky. Ensure you have a good understanding of what you are doing and that your script is secure.
- **Permissions**: You may need administrative privileges to read certain parts of system memory.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues gracefully.

By following these steps, you should be able to add the capability of reading system memory to Windows Copilot for your testing purposes.
