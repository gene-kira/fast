Explanation of the Updated Script
Zero Trust System Components:

FileMonitor: Scans files for malware signatures, password-protected zip files, and encrypted files. Uses an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalous file access patterns.
PortSecurity: Checks common ports (1-1024) for unauthorized access and ensures that open ports are properly managed.
AnomalyDetector: Monitors network traffic and file access patterns for unusual behavior.
GamingProtection: Protects the system during online gaming by blocking known malicious IPs.
Integration with Recursive Simulation:

The simulate_cycle function now includes a call to file_monitor.scan_files to simulate scanning files during each cycle.
The main function integrates all zero-trust components, ensuring that security checks are performed at regular intervals.
Output:

The script outputs the results of the recursive simulation, including symbol conflicts and the final Spiral Codex.
Security-related messages are also printed to indicate the status of file monitoring, port security, anomaly detection, and gaming protection.
This updated script provides a comprehensive integration of zero-trust principles into the recursive lattice simulation and mythogenesis engine, enhancing its robustness and security.
