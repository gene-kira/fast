Explanation
Auto-Install Libraries: The install_libraries function checks if each library in the required_libraries list is installed. If not, it uses pip to install the missing libraries.

Get Network Interfaces: The get_network_interfaces function retrieves all network interfaces except the loopback interface (lo).

Scan Network: The scan_network function uses nmap to perform a ping scan on the specified network (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24). It returns a list of all hosts that responded.

Get IoT Devices: The get_iot_devices function filters the scanned hosts to identify devices with MAC addresses, which are likely to be IoT devices.

Monitor Traffic: The monitor_traffic function uses iptables to monitor network traffic for each identified IoT device. It checks if the number of packets exceeds a defined threshold (SUSPICIOUS_TRAFFIC_THRESHOLD). If so, it marks the device as suspicious.

Isolate Device: The isolate_device function adds iptables rules to block all incoming and outgoing traffic for the specified IP address.

Main Loop: The script continuously scans the network interfaces at a specified interval (SCAN_INTERVAL). For each interface, it performs a network scan, identifies IoT devices, monitors their traffic, and isolates any suspicious devices.

This comprehensive script will help you protect your system from compromised IoT devices by automatically identifying, monitoring, and isolating them.
