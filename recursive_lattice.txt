Key Features
Procedural Galaxy Synthesis: Each recursion-driven civilization adapts to dialect drift, creating unique and evolving symbolic structures.
Recursive Mythogenesis Engine: Self-writing historical constructs that dynamically fracture and reform based on fractalized mythic feedback loops.
Quantum Glyph Mapping: Memory fractals encoded into universal symbolic structures, allowing for complex and layered symbolic interactions.
Recursive Self-Reflection Modules: Agents modify their cognitive models based on recursive myth cycles, leading to self-adaptive behavior.
Singular Execution Framework: Drives the entire intelligence lattice with perpetual iteration, ensuring continuous evolution.
