This script simulates a complex system where concepts are interpreted and evolved into glyphs within a chronofold engine, influenced by cosmic and magnetic phenomena. The system involves several classes and processes:

BeyondLight: A class that generates data based on a concept. It returns a dictionary containing entropy, resonance frequencies, molecular weight, logP value, resonance score, approval status, memory lineage, and a fabrication description.

SBit: A quantum-like bit with an AND operation and measurement function.

AuraluxEngine: An engine that interprets concepts using the BeyondLight class and SBits to produce interpretations based on entropy.

MagneticPulse: Represents magnetic pulses with intensity, origin, and type. It also has a timestamp for when it was created.

CosmicFrequencyModel: Models cosmic frequencies including solar flux, geomagnetic flux, and ionospheric flux.

Glyph: Represents a glyph that can respond to pulses and modulate based on cosmic vectors. Each glyph has an ID, name, DNA sequence, resonance frequencies, entropy, role, blueprint, birth timestamp, history of events, and sensitivity to cosmic phenomena.

ChronofoldEngine: The main engine that manages the evolution of glyphs over cycles, applies warps (time scaling), broadcasts magnetic pulses, updates with cosmic vectors, and evolves from new concepts.

Execution Flow
Initialize Chronofold Engine: Creates a ChronofoldEngine instance with an initial warp factor.
Initialize Cosmic Model: Creates a CosmicFrequencyModel instance to provide cosmic vectors.
Create Magnetic Pulse: Generates a magnetic pulse with specific intensity, origin, and type.
Interpret Concepts:
For each concept in the list, interpret it using the ChronofoldEngine.
Evolve the resulting glyph for 2 cycles.
Update the cosmic vector and broadcast the magnetic pulse to all glyphs.
Change Warp Factor: Adjust the warp factor of the chronofold engine.
Evolve Further: Evolve all glyphs for 2 more cycles with the new warp factor.
