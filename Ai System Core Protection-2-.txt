Key Points of the Script
Logging Initialization:

Initializes a comprehensive logging system to capture all significant events and warnings.
Operating System Detection:

Detects the operating system using platform.system() to tailor commands and libraries accordingly.
Dynamic Library Loading:

Dynamically loads required libraries based on the operating system, ensuring compatibility with both Windows and Unix-based systems.
Configuration File for Customization:

Allows users to customize certain parameters such as scraping interval, monitoring interval, and file paths using a configuration file (system_protection_config.ini).
Resource Management:

Optimizes resource usage by checking system specifications (e.g., CPU and memory) and adjusting the script's behavior accordingly.
Error Handling and Logging:

Enhances error handling to capture and log any issues that may arise during execution, ensuring robustness across different environments.
Threat Intelligence Scraping:

Continuously scrapes threat intelligence from multiple sources (e.g., 
https://example.com/threats

, 
https://threatintelligence.net

).
Identifies and adds new threats to a local database (threat_intelligence.csv).
Behavioral Data Collection:

Collects detailed information about running processes including process ID, name, username, command line arguments, network connections, open files, and memory usage.
Machine Learning Model Training:

Trains a RandomForestClassifier using collected behavioral data to detect suspicious activities.
Features include checks for common AI-related names (e.g., python, java), command line arguments for AI-related keywords, network connection checks for established TCP connections, file access pattern checks (number of open files), and memory usage checks.
Real-Time Process Monitoring:

Continuously monitors all running processes to detect suspicious activities in real-time.
Uses the trained machine learning model to predict if a process is likely to be an AI imposter or malicious activity.
Logs warnings for any detected suspicious processes.
File Integrity Checks:

Updates a list of known safe file hashes (known_safe_hashes.txt).
Verifies the integrity of critical system files against this list to ensure no tampering has occurred.
By implementing these enhancements, the script becomes more robust and adaptable, ensuring it can run efficiently on various types of equipment.
