Explanation of the Enhancements
Voice Integration:

We added a speak function that uses Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to convert text to speech and plays it using the playsound library.
This function is called whenever an important event occurs, such as detecting high-frequency actions or changes in critical files.
Reactivation of Processes:

The protect_core_processes function now speaks a message when a process is not running and attempts to restart it using systemctl.
Continuous Monitoring and Protection:

The main loop checks every minute for changes in critical files, core processes, and behavior patterns.
It uses the speak function to announce any significant events detected during each check.
This script now has a robust mechanism for monitoring system integrity, detecting anomalies, and ensuring that critical services are running. It also provides voice alerts to make it more user-friendly and effective in its mission to protect and enhance the system.
