Explanation:
Import Necessary Libraries: The script imports all required libraries for network monitoring, system resource management, file system monitoring, and machine learning.

Initialize the AI Bot:

port_range: Defines the range of ports to monitor.
open_ports: A set to store currently open ports.
rogue_programs: A set to store detected rogue programs.
network_traffic: A list to store network traffic data for analysis.
if_model: An Isolation Forest model from scikit-learn for anomaly detection.
Network Monitoring:

Use pyshark to capture and analyze network packets in real-time.
The process_packet method captures TCP packets and stores source and destination ports in network_traffic.
System Resource Management:

Monitor CPU and memory usage using psutil.
Detect rogue programs by checking if the process name starts with 'malicious' or if the CPU usage is above 50%.
File System Monitoring:

Use watchdog to monitor file changes.
The FileChangeHandler class monitors file modifications and checks for suspicious content.
Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection:

Collect system resource data (CPU and memory usage) over 100 samples.
Train an Isolation Forest model using the collected data to detect anomalies in system resources.
Continuous Monitoring:

Continuously monitor system resources for anomalies.
If an anomaly is detected, print a message indicating that an anomaly has been found.
Port Management:

Scan all ports in the specified range and close any open ports to ensure the system is secure.
