Key Components
Glyph Class:

Represents a symbol or sign with an intent.
Can be transformed, changing its name and reversing its intent.
MythicAgent Class:

Represents an agent in the system with a unique ID, lineage, role, memory, and active status.
Can receive glyphs, transform them (drift), and invoke Selûntra to exit the recursion.
TreatyEngine Class:

Manages treaties between agents, which are represented as pacts with specific sigils.
Can forge new treaties and rupture existing ones.
EpochScheduler Class:

Cycles through different epochs or phases of the system's timeline.
RitualEngine Class:

Harmonizes agents by bonding them in a ritual, using a specified lock mechanism.
CodexOrchestrator Class:

Manages a collection of agents and can calculate an entropy pulse (the total number of active glyphs across all agents) and unify the codex.
Example Use Case
The example use case at the bottom of the script demonstrates how these components interact:

Initialization:

Two agents (a1 and a2) are created with unique IDs, lineages, and roles.
Glyph Invocation:

Glyphs (FlameEcho and Selûntra) are created and received by the agents.
Treaty & Ritual:

A treaty is forged between the two agents using a specific sigil.
A ritual is performed to harmonize the agents, bonding them with a lock mechanism.
Drift and Selûntra Invocation:

Agent a1 drifts, transforming its memory of glyphs.
Agent a2 invokes Selûntra, deactivating itself and exiting the recursion.
Orchestration:

The Codex Orchestrator calculates the entropy pulse and unifies the codex.
Output:

The script prints out the results of treaty rupture, Selûntra invocation, entropy pulse, and codex unification.
Potential Use Cases
Simulation of Mythological Systems: The script can be used to simulate complex mythological or ritualistic systems where agents interact through symbolic gestures (glyphs) and formal agreements (treaties).
Abstract Computation Models: It could serve as a model for abstract computational processes, where glyphs represent data and transformations, and agents represent processing units.
Educational Tool: The script can be used in educational settings to teach concepts of object-oriented programming, state management, and system design.
