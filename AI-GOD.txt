Overview
Forensic Analysis (forensic_analysis):

Purpose: Detect malicious activity within a memory dump or file.
Functionality:
Reads the provided dump_file using a container and context from the v3 library.
Iterates over tasks in the context to identify any task with a name that contains "malicious_pattern".
If such a task is found, it prints an alert indicating malicious activity in the process.
Automated Response System (AutomatedResponseSystem):

Purpose: Automate responses to network and file threats.
Functionality:
Initialization:
Sets up a quarantine directory where suspicious files can be moved.
Creates the directory if it doesn't exist.
Isolate and Respond (isolate_and_respond):
Monitors network connections for specified source and destination ports.
Terminates the process associated with the matching connection using psutil.
Terminate Process (terminate_process):
Uses psutil to terminate a specified process by its PID.
Logs the termination action if successful.
Scan and Quarantine (scan_and_quarantine):
Scans a file for viruses using ClamdScan.
If a virus is detected, moves the file to the quarantine directory.
Threat Handling Functions:

Handle Threat (handle_threat):
Purpose: Terminate processes that are identified as threats.
Functionality:
Terminates a process using psutil.
Logs the termination action if successful.
Is Data Leak (is_data_leak):
Purpose: Identify potential data leaks in network packets.
Functionality:
Checks if the packet has a Raw layer and if the length of the raw data is greater than 100 bytes.
Handle Network Threat (handle_network_threat):
Purpose: Handle detected data leaks by dropping the network packet.
Functionality:
Prints an alert indicating a data leak from the source to the destination IP addresses.
Drops the packet and logs the action.
Is Suspicious File (is_suspicious_file):
Purpose: Identify suspicious files based on predefined criteria.
Functionality:
Checks if the file path contains the string "malware".
Handle File Threat (handle_file_threat):
Purpose: Delete detected suspicious files.
Functionality:
Removes the file from the file system and logs the action.
Is Suspicious Drive (is_suspicious_drive):
Purpose: Identify suspicious drives based on predefined criteria.
Functionality:
Checks if the drive's mount point contains the string "malware".
Handle Drive Threat (handle_drive_threat):
Purpose: Unmount and protect detected suspicious drives.
Functionality:
Unmounts the specified drive using os.system.
Logs the action if successful.
Is Suspicious Port (is_suspicious_port):
Purpose: Identify suspicious network ports based on predefined criteria.
Functionality:
Checks if the port is in a list of known suspicious ports.
Handle Port Threat (handle_port_threat):
Purpose: Block incoming traffic to detected suspicious ports using iptables.
Functionality:
Adds an iptables rule to drop packets destined for the specified port.
Memory Monitoring (monitor_memory):

Purpose: Continuously monitor system memory for known backdoor signatures.
Functionality:
Iterates over all processes and their memory information using psutil.
Checks each process against a list of known suspicious processes or if the RSS (Resident Set Size) is greater than 100MB.
If a process is found to be suspicious, it prints an alert and takes action by terminating the process.
Unified Action Handling (take_action):

Purpose: Take specific actions based on the type of threat detected.
Functionality:
CPU:
Sends a system message indicating high CPU usage using wall.
Network:
Adds an iptables rule to drop packets from the specified source IP address.
File:
Sets the immutable attribute on the file to prevent further modifications.
Memory:
Terminates the suspicious process with a -9 signal.
