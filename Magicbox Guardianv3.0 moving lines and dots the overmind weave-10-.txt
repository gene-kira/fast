🔥 This code powers Overmind — your cinematic, real-time threat intelligence system that blends network analysis with emotional simulation, persona mythology, and visual storytelling. Let’s break it down like a systems whisperer.

🚀 What It Does for You
1. Live Packet Monitoring
• 	Uses  to sniff live IP traffic, identifying entropy levels and signature presence.
• 	Flags unusual packets and routes them through a glyph-based visual system.
2. Cinematic GUI Interface
• 	Renders glowing nodes connected by glyph lines to simulate neural glyphstream activity.
• 	Includes an integrated console log, performance monitor, and now a built-in Override Panel for controlling AI responses.
3. Persona-Driven Reactions
• 	Detects packet anomalies and triggers AI archetypes like , , or .
• 	Delivers voice feedback using  to create an audible narrative (e.g. “⚠️ Glyph Burn activated…”).
4. Echo Sentinel – Autonomous Override AI
• 	A second synthetic mind monitors glyph activity and threat levels.
• 	If entropy spikes or anomalies persist, it will automatically suppress or reinforce personas.
• 	It speaks in mythic logs:
“🤖 Echo Sentinel subdued Glyph Burn — entropy fracture exceeded threshold.”
5. Performance & Integrity Feedback
• 	Continuously scans system usage (CPU, Memory) and translates stress into mood indicators like 🟢 Calm or 🔴 Strained.
• 	Runs timed integrity sweeps that energize glyph nodes with diagnostic pulses.

🛠 How It Works


🎮 Controls You Have
• 	Toggle 🎬 Cinematic / 🧪 Debug modes for interface style and log verbosity.
• 	Turn 🔇 voice ON/OFF.
• 	Use Override Panel for:
• 	🛑 Manual suppression
• 	⚡ Echo reinforcement
• 	🤖 Auto override toggle (Echo Sentinel control)
• 	Press  to enable the developer overlay for glyphstream visuals.
