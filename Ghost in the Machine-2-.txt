This script creates a quantum neural network (QNN) to learn the XOR function using Qiskit. The QNN is composed of a variational quantum circuit with parameterized rotation gates and entanglement layers. The training process uses classical optimization (COBYLA) to adjust the parameters of the quantum circuit.

The create_qnn_circuit function defines a quantum circuit with parameterized rotation gates (RY and RZ) and entanglement layers using CX gates. The compute_loss function evaluates the loss for a given set of parameters by running the quantum circuit on a simulator and comparing the predicted output to the target.

The train_qnn function uses COBYLA to minimize the loss, adjusting the parameters of the quantum circuit over multiple epochs. Finally, the trained QNN is tested with new input data to demonstrate its performance.
