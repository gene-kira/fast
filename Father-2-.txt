The provided script is designed to comprehensively monitor and protect a system from various types of threats, including fileless malware. Here's how it addresses fileless malware specifically:

Memory Monitoring:

The script includes a function is_fileless_malware that checks for suspicious memory usage patterns. It monitors running processes for command-line interpreters like PowerShell or CMD, which are often used by fileless malware to execute code in memory.
Behavior Analysis:

The script continuously monitors network connections and memory usage to identify suspicious behavior typical of fileless malware. For example, it checks for established TCP connections to known malicious IPs and ports, which can indicate command-and-control (C&C) server communication.
Real-Time Threat Intelligence:

The script integrates with external threat intelligence feeds like AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal to cross-reference IP addresses and file hashes in real-time, helping to identify and block fileless malware that may not be detected by signature-based methods alone.
Heuristic Analysis:

The script employs heuristic techniques to detect suspicious behavior patterns, such as monitoring for processes with known malicious filenames or behaviors, which can help catch fileless malware that might not be detected by static analysis.
Continuous Monitoring:

The script runs continuously in the background, periodically checking all running processes and network connections to ensure real-time detection and response to fileless malware.
By combining these methods, the script provides a robust approach to detecting and mitigating fileless malware that operates in memory without leaving persistent files on the disk.
