🌼 What This Code Does
This is a symbolic ritual server built in Python using Flask. It creates a poetic API and web interface where users can:
- 🫧 Whisper glyphs: Submit symbolic messages via /whisper
- 🌱 Bloom glyphs: View recently activated glyphs via /glyphs/active
- 🎭 Send emotional tone: Register a tone like gentle, hopeful, or quiet via /presence
- 🔮 Forecast: Get glyph suggestions based on a mood via /forecast
- 📜 View echoes: See recent glyph whispers and messages via /echoes
- 🧪 Explore the system: Use /playground to test endpoints
- 🌐 Access the Bloomboard: A lightweight browser interface for ritual interaction at /bloomboard
It stores everything in memory (no database needed), includes a soft autoloader to check dependencies, and is fully self-contained in a single Python file. It’s perfect for ambient games, emotional AI companions, or symbolic art installations.
