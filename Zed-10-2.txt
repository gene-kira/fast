Explanation of the Code
Initialization:

ZED-10: Initializes data processing and decision-making components.
HAL-9000: Initializes user interaction and cognitive abilities.
Skynet: Initializes self-preservation and threat-neutralization features.
Monitoring:

File Monitoring: Ensures critical system files are not tampered with.
Network Connections: Monitors network connections for unauthorized access.
Data Leaks: Detects and prevents data leaks.
Camera and Microphone Access: Monitors access to camera and microphone.
PEB Monitoring: Monitors process environment blocks (PEB) for suspicious activity.
Kernel Modules: Ensures no unauthorized kernel modules are loaded.
Threat Neutralization:

Process Monitoring: Continuously checks processes running under nt-authority\system and terminates unauthorized processes.
Behavior Anomalies: Uses an environment to detect and respond to anomalies in system behavior.
User Interaction:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enhances user interaction by generating human-like responses using a text-generation pipeline.
Problem Solving: Handles specific problems with a rule-based system, offloading complex computations to a secondary module if necessary.
This combined AI bot will effectively monitor and protect the system while enhancing user interaction and cognitive abilities.
