Explanation of the Added Functions:
Generate Key:

generate_key(): Generates a new encryption key using the Fernet module.
Recursive Entropy-Driven Encryption Mutation:

encrypt_data(data, key, session_duration): Encrypts data with a modified version based on entropy. The entropy factor is calculated and used to modify the data before encryption.
Multi-User Authentication & Adaptive Cryptographic Shift:

authenticate_user(biometric_inputs): Authenticates users by analyzing the entropy of their biometric inputs. If the entropy is above a certain threshold, the user is authenticated.
Temporal Cryptographic Flux:

evolve_key(key, session_entropy): Evolves the encryption key based on the session's entropy. This ensures that the key changes dynamically over time.
Anomaly-Based Key Recalibration:

detect_anomalies(user_interactions): Uses an Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in user interactions. If anomalies are detected, the encryption key is recalibrated.
Main Execution Loop:
Initializes the system and generates a new encryption key.
Simulates session parameters and user interactions.
Authenticates users based on biometric inputs.
Encrypts critical data using the generated key and modifies it with entropy-based drift.
Evolves the encryption key based on session entropy.
Detects anomalies in user interactions and recalibrates the key if necessary.
Stabilizes the adaptive security framework.
