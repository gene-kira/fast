This script initializes an AI system with various components for perception, reasoning, learning, and self-awareness. It combines all the necessary modules to process visual, audio, and tactile data, make decisions based on this data, learn from interactions, and update its emotional state.

Key Components:
Memory System: Manages short-term and long-term memory.
Attention Mechanism: Adjusts attention weights dynamically.
Reasoning Module: Combines logical and probabilistic reasoning.
Visual Perception: Processes images using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Audio Perception: Processes audio using MFCC features and a dense neural network.
Tactile Perception: Manages tactile sensor data.
Kinematic Control: Controls the movement of joints based on target positions.
Self Awareness: Reflects on current capabilities and limitations.
Meta Cognition: Adds thoughts to the meta-cognitive system.
Reinforcement Learning: Updates Q-table for reinforcement learning.
Transfer Learning: Trains a shared model across multiple tasks.
Continuous Learning: Continuously updates the model with new data
