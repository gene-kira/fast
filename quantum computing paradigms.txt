Explanation of Enhancements:
Quantum-State Entanglement Refinement:

Added multi_phase_quantum_field_reinforcement method to the QuantumCoherenceCore class, which applies multi-phase quantum field reinforcement to the state vector.
This method uses complex exponentials to introduce phase shifts and then applies entropy compensation.
Synthetic Neural Matrices:

Added recursive_abstraction_field method to the RecursiveIntelligenceLayer class, which enhances foresight alignment through self-reinforcing neural fractals.
This method uses a fractal factor based on exponential decay to modulate the cognition stream.
Quantum-Resonance Execution Mapping:

Added quantum_resonance_execution_mapping method to the MultiAgentCognitionSwarm class, which integrates entangled quantum states with recursive intelligence layering.
This method uses a resonance factor based on cosine functions to enhance the input data before applying recursive abstraction.
Main Execution:
The main execution script initializes and runs each component of the system, demonstrating the integration of classical and quantum computing paradigms for advanced intelligence layering.
