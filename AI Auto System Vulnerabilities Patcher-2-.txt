This script is a comprehensive system monitor that leverages multiple threads to efficiently detect and mitigate potential security threats across various aspects of the system. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each component:

1. Library Installation
The script starts by ensuring that all necessary libraries are installed:

watchdog: For file system monitoring.
psutil: For process and network connection management.
scapy: For network packet analysis (not directly used in this script but can be useful for advanced network monitoring).
pywin32: For Windows-specific functionalities, including process and driver management.
2. File Monitoring
The file monitoring component uses the watchdog library to observe changes in a specified directory. It checks for modifications to files and ensures that any modified files are restored if they differ from their original state.

FileMonitor Class:
on_modified: This method is triggered when a file in the monitored directory is modified.
is_password_protected: Checks if the file is password protected by attempting to read it.
is_encrypted: Placeholder for checking if the file is encrypted (implementation details are left to the user).
get_md5: Computes the MD5 hash of the file to identify changes.
check_file: Verifies if the modified file is different from its original state and restores it if necessary.
3. Network Monitoring
The network monitoring component ensures that only trusted connections are allowed, blocking suspicious or untrusted connections.

block_p2p_and_emule:

Scans for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) and eMule connections on common ports (6346, 6347).
Blocks any detected P2P/eMule connections by terminating the associated process.
monitor_network_connections:

Continuously monitors all network connections.
Blocks connections to untrusted IP addresses.
4. Data Leak Monitoring
This component identifies processes that might be leaking sensitive data and terminates them.

check_data_leaks:
Monitors running processes for known data-leaking applications (e.g., Microsoft Office apps).
Terminates any detected processes.
5. Camera and Microphone Access Monitoring
This component ensures that only trusted processes can access the camera and microphone.

monitor_camera_mic_access:
Continuously monitors all running processes.
Identifies processes known to use the camera or microphone (e.g., Skype, Zoom).
Terminates any detected processes.
6. PEB Monitoring
This component checks for anomalies in the PEB of each process to detect potential tampering.

monitor_peb:
Monitors all running processes.
Reads the PEB of each process and checks for unexpected changes, such as invalid environment block pointers or suspicious strings.
7. Kernel Module Inspection
This component ensures that only trusted kernel modules are loaded by monitoring and unloading any untrusted drivers.

check_kernel_modules:
Enumerates all device drivers.
Unloads any untrusted drivers by freeing the library handle associated with the driver.
Main Function
The main function initializes all components and starts them in separate threads for efficient parallel processing:
