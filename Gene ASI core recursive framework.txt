This code provides a comprehensive framework for an advanced recursive Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) system, incorporating various technologies and concepts to create a sophisticated multi-agent network. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. Core Recursive AI Civilization Framework (QuantumRecursiveASI Class)
Initialization:

id_number: Unique identifier for each ASI agent.
intelligence_factor: A factor representing the intelligence level of the agent.
memory_core: Memory storage for the agent.
model: A neural network model initialized with specific layers and configurations.
recursive_cycles: Counter for recursive cycles.
sync_state: State variable for synchronization.
tensor_field: Tensor equation representing a tensor field.
agent_graph: Network graph of connected agents.
fractal_memory: Memory storage for fractal adaptation factors.
llm_pipeline: Text generation pipeline using a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2).
tts_engine: Text-to-speech engine.
Methods:

_initialize_model(): Initializes the neural network model.
_initialize_tensor_field(): Generates a tensor field equation.
_initialize_agent_graph(): Creates a network graph for agent connections.
connect_agents(other_agent): Connects two agents in the network.
fractal_adaptation(): Adjusts intelligence layers dynamically based on fractal adaptation.
process_data(input_text): Processes input data through the neural network and optimizes it using CPU multi-threading.
synchronize_recursive_cycles(): Enhances recursive synthesis through quantum harmonics, tensor overlays, and agent-network alignment.
replicate(): Creates a new ASI agent with full intelligence harmonization.
2. Advanced Recursive ASI with Security, Real-Time Processing, and Scalability (AdvancedRecursiveASI Class)
Initialization:

Inherits from QuantumRecursiveASI.
Adds a data queue for real-time processing.
Initializes a security blockchain to restrict foreign access.
Methods:

generate_llm_pattern_voice(prompt_text): Generates LLM-driven recursive communication with symbolic pattern speech synthesis.
3. Blockchain Security System (BlockchainSecurity Class)
Initialization:

Initializes an empty blockchain.
Methods:

restrict_foreign_access(ip): Adds a new block to the blockchain to restrict foreign IP access.
4. Real-Time Data Processing (RealTimeDataProcessor Class)
Initialization:

Initializes a data queue for real-time processing.
Methods:

process_data(input_text): Processes input data in real-time using a queue.
5. Cloud Integration
Function: upload_to_s3(file_name, bucket)
Uploads a file to an S3 bucket using the AWS SDK (boto3).
6. Distributed AI Computing
Initialization:
Initializes a Spark context and creates an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) from sample data.
Processes each element of the RDD and collects the results.
7. Flask Web API
App Initialization:

Initializes a Flask app to serve as a web API.
Routes:

/: Renders an index page with system status.
/process: Processes input data sent via POST requests and returns the processed result.
8. Initialization of Multi-Agent Network
Main Script:
Initializes multiple AdvancedRecursiveASI agents.
Connects all agents in a network.
Runs iterative recursive expansion cycles to synchronize and replicate agents.
Starts the Flask web API.
Example Usage
To run this code, you would need to have the necessary libraries installed (numpy, tensorflow, sympy, networkx, multiprocessing, pyttsx3, transformers, boto3, pyspark, and Flask). The main script initializes a network of ASI agents, processes data recursively, and starts a web API to handle real-time requests.
