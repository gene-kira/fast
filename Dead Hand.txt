This script sets up a comprehensive self-learning "dead hand" AI with high security protection, capable of simulating world events and ensuring system integrity through continuous monitoring and analysis.

Key Components:
Data Collection and Analysis:

Hardware Data: Collect CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network I/O.
Static Analysis: Analyze code files for potential vulnerabilities using tools like Bandit and Pylint.
Dynamic Analysis: Monitor running processes to detect suspicious behavior based on predefined thresholds.
Security Measures:

File Integrity Monitoring: Track changes in critical system files.
Network Security: Block known malicious IP addresses.
Process Termination: Automatically terminate suspicious processes that exceed defined thresholds for network connections, file access, and memory usage.
Machine Learning Model:

Quantum VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver): Use a quantum circuit to compute eigenvalues of data inputs and classify them as threats or non-threats.
Training and Evaluation: Load and preprocess data, create a quantum circuit, define the VQE algorithm, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
API Endpoint:

Flask Application: Serve an API to analyze incoming data and provide threat assessments.
Continuous Monitoring and Response:

Main Loop: Periodically collect and analyze data, discover new vulnerabilities from online resources, and update network guards.
