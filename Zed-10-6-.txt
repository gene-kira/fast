This code provides a robust AI bot that can monitor and manage system processes, detect anomalies, and respond to user queries. It integrates machine learning for anomaly detection, NLP for generating human-like responses, and offloading complex tasks to a secondary module for better performance.

Key Components:
Initialization:

Critical Files: Define critical files that the bot will monitor.
AI-specific Names: Identify AI-related keywords in process names and command line arguments.
Thresholds: Set thresholds for network connections, file access patterns, and memory usage to detect anomalies.
Process Monitoring:

Terminate Processes: Function to terminate specific processes by name or PID.
Anomaly Detection: Use an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalous behavior in system processes.
File Monitoring: Monitor critical files for integrity and unauthorized access.
Network Monitoring: Detect suspicious network connections.
Device Access Monitoring: Monitor access to camera and microphone devices.
PEB Monitoring: Check the Process Environment Block (PEB) for tampering.
Kernel Module Monitoring: Ensure that only trusted kernel modules are loaded.
User Interaction:

Generate Response: Use an NLP pipeline to generate human-like responses to user queries.
Handle Specific Problems: Implement rule-based logic to handle specific issues (e.g., performance diagnostics).
Offloading Complex Tasks:

Secondary Module: Offload complex tasks to a secondary module for better performance and resource management.
Continuous Monitoring:

The bot runs continuously, periodically checking system processes and user inputs.
