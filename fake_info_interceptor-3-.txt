Key Enhancements:
Automatic Game Detection:

The train_game_detection_model function uses a RandomForestClassifier to detect the game process automatically.
This model is trained on data collected from running processes, distinguishing between the target game and other processes.
Enhanced Packet Collection:

The collect_packets function now collects packets from multiple game processes if there are multiple instances of the game running.
It filters out irrelevant packets by focusing on specific game-related traffic.
Advanced AI for Data Modification:

The train_model function uses a RandomForestClassifier to predict which packets are from the game process and should be modified.
The generate_fake_ip_and_port function creates more sophisticated fake data that mimics real user behavior, enhancing the realism of the modified packets.
These improvements ensure that the script can automatically detect the game process, collect relevant traffic, and modify packets in a way that is less likely to trigger anti-cheat systems
