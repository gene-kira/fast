Explanation
Model Definition: The AI_Brain class defines a neural network with visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric processing layers.
Data Collection and Preprocessing: The collect_and_preprocess_data function collects visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric data and converts them into tensors.
Training Function: The train_model function trains the model using a simple loop with dummy target values for demonstration purposes.
Real-Time Inference: The real_time_inference function continuously collects data and runs inference on the trained model, printing the outputs.
Reinforcement Learning: The reinforce_model function updates the model parameters based on a reward signal.
Note
Tactile and Biometric Sensors: The script assumes that tactile_sensor.read() and biometric_sensor.read() are functions provided by your hardware or simulation environment.
Reward Function: The reinforcement learning function uses a simple reward-based loss. You may need to adjust the reward calculation based on your specific application.
This script should provide a complete and functional setup for your AI brain model with real-time inference and initial reinforcement learning capabilities.
