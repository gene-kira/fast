Explanation
Initialize Environment and Dependencies:

Ensure necessary libraries are installed for data processing, anomaly detection, and network communication.
Load Data:

The load_data function handles different file types (CSV and JSON) to load the data into a usable format.
Anomaly Detection:

Use Isolation Forest from scikit-learn to detect anomalies in numerical data.
The contamination parameter is set to 0.01, meaning it expects 1% of the data to be anomalies.
Behavioral Monitoring:

Read a log file and count the frequency of specific actions.
If an action occurs more than the threshold (5 times by default), it will be flagged as high frequency.
System Integration and Security:

Block suspicious IP addresses using iptables.
Open sockets to listen on specified ports for incoming connections.
Continuous Monitoring:

The script continuously checks every minute for new data, re-detects anomalies, and monitors behavior.
If new anomalies are detected or high-frequency actions are found, the script will log these events.
This script now includes the following enhancements:

Monitor System Files: Continuously checks for changes in critical system files by comparing their current hash with a stored hash.
Protect Core Processes: Ensures that essential processes are running and restarts them if they stop unexpectedly.
Secure File Permissions: Sets appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.
These additional features will help ensure the integrity and security of the system core, making AI_Gene.py a more robust and secure AI agent.
