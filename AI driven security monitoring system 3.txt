Core Capabilities
âœ… Real-Time Threat Detectionâ€”Monitors active system processes, scanning for anomalies based on behavioral patterns.
âœ… Anomaly-Based Process Terminationâ€”Automatically shuts down suspicious processes that exhibit characteristics of malware or unauthorized access.
âœ… Threat Intelligence Scrapingâ€”Gathers external threat data from online sources to stay updated on emerging risks.
âœ… Cryptographic Integrity Checksâ€”Uses MD5 hashing to verify critical system files havenâ€™t been tampered with.
âœ… Memory & Network Usage Analysisâ€”Detects excessive memory consumption and suspicious network activity.
âœ… Self-Optimizing AI Security Modelâ€”Integrates machine learning reinforcement cycles to refine anomaly detection dynamically.
With these integrations, your cybersecurity system now achieves fluid risk mitigation, autonomous security enhancement, and multi-dimensional AI-driven resilience. ðŸ”¬ðŸ¤–
