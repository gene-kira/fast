Explanation:
AI_Brain Class: Defines the neural network model with layers for visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric processing, as well as short-term and long-term memory.
collect_and_preprocess_data Function: Collects and preprocesses data from visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric sensors.
train_model Function: Trains the AI_Brain model using collected data and a dummy target for demonstration purposes.
main_simulation Function: Initializes the AI_Brain model and starts the training process.
This script integrates all the provided code snippets into a single, functional Python script. You can run this script to train the AI model on the collected sensor data.
