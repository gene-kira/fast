Key Enhancements:
Auto Loader Function:

The auto_loader function centralizes the loading of all necessary libraries, ensuring that the script is well-prepared for execution.
Email Access Configuration:

Configures access to the email inbox using the imbox library, which is essential for fetching and processing emails.
Machine Learning Models:

Loads pre-trained machine learning models including a Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier), Support Vector Machine (SVC), and Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). These models are used to predict the likelihood of an email being malicious.
Quantum-Inspired Techniques:

Uses Qiskit to simulate quantum superposition and entanglement, enhancing the detection of complex patterns in emails.
Email Encryption:

Configures PGP encryption using python-gnupg to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
Resource Monitoring:

Uses psutil to monitor CPU and memory usage, logging high resource usage for optimization.
Behavioral Analysis Configuration:

Sets up a user history dictionary to track trusted contacts and their interaction metrics.
Cloud-Based Email Filtering:

Configures SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records in the domain's DNS settings to enhance email security using cloud-based services like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.
Email Content Extraction Utilities:

Uses BeautifulSoup from bs4 to parse HTML content and extract plain text for analysis.
Resource Monitoring Thread:

Starts a separate thread to continuously monitor CPU and memory usage, logging high usage for potential optimization.
