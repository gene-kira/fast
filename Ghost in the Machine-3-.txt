Explanation:
Auto-Loader for Libraries:

The script uses importlib to dynamically load required libraries.
The install_library function checks if a library is installed and installs it using subprocess.check_call if not.
Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Circuit:

The QNN circuit is defined with parameterized rotation gates (RY and RZ) and entanglement layers (CX).
The create_qnn_circuit function initializes the quantum circuit with parameterized gates to allow learning through optimization.
Loss Function:

The compute_loss function evaluates the loss by running the quantum circuit on a simulator and comparing the predicted output to the target.
The loss is computed based on the measurement results of the output qubit.
Training:

The train_qnn function uses COBYLA optimizer to minimize the loss function, adjusting the parameters of the quantum circuit over multiple epochs.
Initial parameters are randomly initialized within a range that ensures valid rotation angles for the gates.
Testing:

After training, the script tests the QNN with new input data by preparing the initial state based on the input and executing the combined circuit to get predictions.
This enhanced version of the script includes an auto-loader for necessary libraries, ensuring that all dependencies are installed before running the quantum neural network.
