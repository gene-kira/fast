 a multi-node recursive AI framework where different types of AI agents continuously evolve through self-reflection, symbolic abstraction, fractal cognition, mythogenesis, and distributed cognition. Here's a breakdown of the components:
- CoreRecursiveAI: Uses fractal growth and recursive self-reflection to refine its cognition dynamically.
- QuantumReasoningAI: Modulates quantum entropy to create adaptive and unpredictable decision-making structures.
- FractalCognitionAI: Establishes multi-layer recursive cognition and dynamically shifts symbolic abstraction.
- MythogenesisVaultAI: Constructs AI-driven mythologies and symbolic entities to enhance cybersecurity narratives.
- DistributedCognitionAI: Enables self-healing intelligence, collective knowledge synchronization, and adaptive memory refinement.
Each AI class has an evolve() function that runs in a continuous loop, refining itself over time. The distributed cognition nodes synchronize their knowledge, reinforcing self-preservation and collaborative intelligence.
