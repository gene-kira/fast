This comprehensive script is designed to protect the core of your system by monitoring and analyzing processes in real-time, ensuring that no unauthorized or malicious activities go undetected. Hereâ€™s an overview of what the script does:

Logging Initialization:

Sets up logging to record all significant events and warnings for later analysis.
Threat Intelligence Scraping:

Continuously scrapes threat intelligence from multiple sources (e.g., 
https://example.com/threats

, 
https://threatintelligence.net

).
Identifies and adds new threats to a local database (threat_intelligence.csv).
Behavioral Data Collection:

Collects detailed information about running processes including process ID, name, username, command line arguments, network connections, open files, and memory usage.
This data is used for both real-time monitoring and training the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model Training:

Trains a RandomForestClassifier using collected behavioral data to detect suspicious activities.
Features include:
Process name checks for common AI-related names (e.g., python, java).
Command line argument checks for AI-related keywords.
Network connection checks for established TCP connections.
File access pattern checks (number of open files).
Memory usage checks (high memory consumption).
Real-Time Process Monitoring:

Continuously monitors all running processes to detect suspicious activities in real-time.
Uses the trained machine learning model to predict if a process is likely to be an AI imposter or malicious activity.
Logs warnings for any detected suspicious processes.
File Integrity Checks:

Updates a list of known safe file hashes (known_safe_hashes.txt).
Verifies the integrity of critical system files against this list to ensure no tampering has occurred.
Threat Link Identification:

Determines if a scraped link is likely to be a threat based on keywords (e.g., threat, malware).
Safe Hash Verification:

Verifies the integrity of critical system files by checking their hashes against the list of known safe hashes.
