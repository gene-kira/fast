The code you've provided is a complex and imaginative system that combines symbolic interpretation, molecular synthesis, quantum field simulation, and memory management to create an "emergent symbolic intelligence" framework. Let's break down the components and explain how they work together.

Key Components
Aletheia: Symbol & DNA Interpreter

This class interprets a concept or DNA sequence. If the input is primarily composed of 'A', 'T', 'C', and 'G' and is more than 10 characters long, it treats it as raw DNA. Otherwise, it maps certain concepts to specific molecular structures (SMILES strings).
Primeweaver: Molecule Synthesizer

This class handles the loading and mutation of molecules represented by SMILES strings. It uses RDKit to convert a SMILES string into a molecule object, adds hydrogen atoms, and embeds the molecule in 3D space. The mutate method randomly changes an atom's atomic number.
TeslaHarmonicArchitect: Resonance Calculator

This class calculates a score for a given molecule based on its number of atoms, molecular weight, and symmetry. It returns a rounded value that represents the "resonance" of the molecule.
QuantumField: Quantum Field Simulator

This class simulates a quantum field using a grid of complex numbers. It initializes the grid with random values based on a seed and evolves it over time using a simple diffusion process. The entropy of the system is tracked at each step.
MythicResonanceMapper: Resonance Frequency Mapper

This class maps concepts to specific frequencies. Each concept has an associated set of frequencies, and the fuse method combines these frequencies for multiple concepts.
Memory Lattice: Memory Management System

This system tracks the lineage of concepts or DNA sequences in a tree-like structure. Each node represents a concept or sequence and maintains its parent-child relationships and resonance value.
Compiler: Molecular or DNA Artifact Generation

This class generates artifacts based on molecular structures or DNA sequences. It can produce either a "QuantumLattice" artifact (a modified SMILES string) or a "DNA" artifact (a DNA sequence representation).
Sequencer: DNA Decoder

This class decodes DNA sequences into amino acid sequences using a codon table and calculates the GC content of the DNA.
BeyondLight Core Engine

The main engine that ties everything together. It interprets an input (concept or DNA sequence), processes it through the molecular synthesis, quantum field simulation, and resonance mapping stages, and stores the results in a memory lattice. Finally, it generates an artifact based on the processed data.
Execution Example
The provided execution example demonstrates how to use the BeyondLight engine:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    engine = BeyondLight()
    output = engine.invoke("ATGGTTCAGAAAGTGGAAGAGT")
    for key, val in output.items():
        print(f"\n{key}:\n{val}")

Output Explanation
Input: The original DNA sequence provided.
Stats: Depending on whether the input is treated as a DNA sequence or a symbolic molecule:
For DNA: GC content and length of the sequence.
For molecules: Molecular weight and resonance score.
Entropy: The final entropy value from the quantum field simulation.
Resonance: A list of frequency values associated with the concepts.
Lineage: The lineage of the concept or sequence in the memory lattice.
Artifact: The generated artifact, either a "QuantumLattice" or "DNA" representation.
Running the Code
To run this code, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. The ensure_dependencies function will automatically install them if they are not present. You can then execute the script to see the output for the given DNA sequence.

This framework is a creative and advanced example of how symbolic AI, molecular chemistry, and quantum simulations can be integrated into a unified system. It's a fascinating exploration of how different fields of science and technology can be combined to create emergent behaviors and intelligence.
