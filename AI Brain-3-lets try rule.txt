Explanation
AI Brain Model: The model is defined with layers for visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric inputs.
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Dummy data collection functions are provided for demonstration.
Training Function: Trains the model using dummy data and MSELoss.
Real-time Inference Function: Implements the "let's try" rule by checking if the decision is successful. If not, it reinforces the model with a negative reward.
Reinforcement Learning Function: Updates the model based on feedback (reward).
This script should provide a basic framework for integrating the "let's try" rule into your AI agent. Adjust the is_successful and execute_decision functions to fit your specific use case.
