Explanation:
Automatic Library Loading:

The load_libraries function ensures all necessary libraries are imported. It handles potential import errors by printing a message if any library fails to load.
Feature Extraction:

The get_running_processes function retrieves a list of all running processes with relevant features: PID, name, CPU percent, memory usage, and network connections.
The extract_features function converts the collected process information into a feature vector suitable for machine learning. It includes:
A binary flag indicating if the process name is in the known miners list.
CPU percent.
Memory usage (converted to MB).
Number of network connections.
Machine Learning Model Training:

The train_model function trains a RandomForestClassifier model using the collected features and labels. It splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy.
Model Deployment:

The is_crypto_miner function uses the trained model to classify a process as a crypto miner.
The terminate_crypto_miner function terminates the identified crypto mining processes.
The monitor_and_terminate function continuously monitors running processes, extracts features, and classifies them using the trained model. It then terminates any processes classified as miners.
Training Data Collection:

A dataset of known miner and non-miner processes is created to train the model. This includes process names, CPU percent, memory usage, network connections, and a binary label indicating if the process is a miner.
The OneHotEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing is used to convert categorical data (process names) into numerical features.
By combining these steps, the script becomes more robust and adaptable, capable of detecting and terminating crypto mining processes with high accuracy.
