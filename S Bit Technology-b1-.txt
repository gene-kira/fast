Explanation:
SBit Class: Defines the S-bit operations (AND, OR, NOT) and measurement.
AIAgent Class: Manages a list of S-bits and provides methods to initialize, perform operations, measure, and solve problems using S-bits.
Main Simulation Functions:
create_warp_bubble: Simulates the warp bubble shape function.
alcubierre_simulation: Simulates the Alcubierre metric.
casimir_effect: Calculates the negative energy density using the Casimir effect.
entangled_particles: Creates a quantum circuit for entangled particles.
execute_circuit: Executes the quantum circuit on a simulator.
teleportation_protocol: Implements the teleportation protocol.
lattice_quantum_gravity_simulation: Simulates lattice quantum gravity.
main_simulation: Combines all the simulations and uses the AIAgent to solve a problem using S-bits.
This script integrates S-bit technology into the main simulation, enhancing the AI agent's capabilities with quantum-inspired operations.
