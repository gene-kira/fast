Explanation
Install Libraries: The script first checks if the necessary libraries are installed and installs them if they are not.
Load Configuration: The configuration file config.yaml is loaded to get paths and API keys.
Hash Function: Generates a SHA-256 hash of the file for unique identification.
Check Against VirusTotal: Uses the VirusTotal API to check if the file is known to be malicious.
Train or Load Model: If a pre-trained model does not exist, it trains a new RandomForestClassifier using a dataset of known malicious and benign files. Otherwise, it loads the existing model.
Extract Features: Extracts static features from the file content for machine learning analysis.
File Monitoring System: Uses watchdog to monitor changes in the specified directory. If a file is modified or created, it processes the file by checking against VirusTotal and using the trained model to predict if it's malicious. If deemed malicious, the file is quarantined.
This script provides a comprehensive solution for detecting and neutralizing information-stealing malware by combining static analysis, machine learning, and real-time monitoring.
