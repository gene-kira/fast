Explanation
Perception System Model: This model processes raw sensor data (e.g., images) and extracts features that can be used by the cognitive engine.
Cognitive Engine Model: This model takes the features extracted by the perception system and generates a high-level strategy.
Strategy Module: This function uses the output from the cognitive engine to determine a high-level strategy.
Tactical Module: This function translates the high-level strategy into specific tactics (e.g., hit-and-run or resource depletion).
Learning System: This function trains the models using provided data and labels.
Usage
Training: Use the train_learning_system function to train the perception and cognitive engine models with your simulation data.
Simulation Step: Use the simulate_step function to simulate a single step in your simulation, which will generate a strategy and tactic based on the input data.
Customization
Data Format: Adjust the input_shape and data generation to match your specific simulation environment.
Strategies and Tactics: Customize the create_strategy and execute_tactics functions to include more sophisticated strategies and tactics as needed.
Training Data: Ensure you have a diverse set of training data that covers various scenarios in your simulation.
