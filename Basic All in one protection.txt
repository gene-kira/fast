Explanation:
Logging Configuration: The logging is configured to write to protection.log with detailed information about the execution and status of each task.
Library Installation: The script checks if all required libraries are installed and installs them if necessary.
Task Runner Function: A function task_runner is defined to run a given task at regular intervals.
Threading for Concurrent Execution: Each task is started in a separate thread to ensure that they can run concurrently without blocking each other.
Main Loop: The main loop keeps the script running and ensures that all threads remain active.
Task Definitions:
scan_email_attachment: Scans email attachments for malicious content.
verify_software_download: Verifies the integrity of software downloads from trusted sources.
