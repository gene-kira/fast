Explanation:
Library Installation:

The install_libraries function ensures that psutil, requests, and scikit-learn are installed if they are not already present.
System Monitoring:

We use psutil to monitor network connections and system processes.
An Isolation Forest model from scikit-learn is used for anomaly detection. The contamination parameter is set to 0.1, meaning that about 10% of the data is expected to be anomalies.
Anomaly Detection:

Collect initial data by monitoring network statistics and process information.
Train the Isolation Forest model with the collected initial data.
Continuously monitor the system and predict if current behavior is anomalous.
Isolation and Shutdown:

If an anomaly is detected, identify the rogue AI process by its name.
Suspend and then kill the identified process to stop it from causing further harm.
Main Function:
The script starts by ensuring all necessary libraries are installed.
It sets up a monitoring system using psutil and an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies.
Once an anomaly is detected, it identifies the rogue AI process by its name and isolates and shuts it down.
This script will continuously monitor your system and take action if a rogue AI is detected. Adjust the sleep interval as needed based on your specific requirements for monitoring frequency.
