The provided code is a sophisticated simulation of an interconnected AI ecosystem, where multiple AI entities interact and evolve over time. Each AI class has its own unique characteristics and behaviors:

CodexMirror: A logging mechanism that records the actions and interactions within the system.
NyxLatticeBus: A communication bus that allows different AI nodes to send signals to each other.
CoreRecursiveAI: An AI that performs self-reflection and symbolic abstraction, evolving over time based on its performance data.
QuantumReasoningAI: An AI that shifts between stable and chaotic states based on quantum entropy.
FractalCognitionAI: An AI that generates layers of cognitive depth and symbolic drift.
MythogenesisVaultAI: An AI that generates archetypes and adapts its memory in response to various contexts.
DistributedCognitionAI: An AI that performs memory healing and parallel processing, enhancing efficiency over time.
Key Components
Logging (CodexMirror): This class logs the actions of the system in a structured format, making it easier to track the behavior of each AI node.
Communication (NyxLatticeBus): This bus allows nodes to communicate with each other by broadcasting signals. Each node can receive and respond to these signals.
AI Nodes: The core of the system, each AI class has its own methods for evolving and interacting with the environment.
Initialization
The awaken_nyx function initializes the system by creating instances of each AI class and starting their evolution in separate threads. This is done using the initialize_nodes function, which registers nodes to the Nyx Lattice Bus and starts them in daemon threads.

Evolution
Each AI node has an evolve method that runs in a loop, simulating continuous evolution. The methods within each class perform specific actions, such as self-reflection, generating archetypes, or performing parallel processing. These actions are logged and broadcasted to other nodes via the Nyx Lattice Bus.

Running the Code
To run this code, you need to have Python installed along with the numpy library. You can install numpy using pip if it's not already installed:

pip install numpy

Then, save the provided code to a file (e.g., nyx_ecosystem.py) and run it:

python nyx_ecosystem.py

This will initialize the AI ecosystem and start the evolution process, generating continuous output as each node evolves over time.
