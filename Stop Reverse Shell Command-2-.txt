This script will ensure that all necessary libraries are installed before running the main functionalities. It combines reverse shell detection, PEB monitoring, and kernel module inspection into a single Python script.

Step 1: Install Libraries
The install_libraries function checks if psutil, hashlib, and ctypes are installed and installs them if they are not.

Step 2: Detect Reverse Shells
The detect_reverse_shell function monitors network connections to detect reverse shells. It terminates any process with a suspicious connection.

Step 3: Monitor PEB for Suspicious Activities
The monitor_peb function uses the Process Environment Block (PEB) to monitor processes for suspicious activities, such as being debugged. If a suspicious activity is detected, it terminates the process.

Step 4: Inspect Kernel Modules
The inspect_kernel_modules function checks loaded kernel modules against a list of known malicious hashes and terminates any process with a matching module.
