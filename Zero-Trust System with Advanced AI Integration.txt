Explanation of the Script
ZeroTrustSystem Class:

Initializes and runs the main components: file monitoring, port security, anomaly detection, and gaming protection.
The run method continuously checks for threats every minute.
FileMonitor Class:

Scans files for malware signatures, personal data, zip files with password protection, encrypted files, and anomalies.
Uses an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalous file access patterns.
PortSecurity Class:

Checks common ports (1-1024) for unauthorized access.
Closes open ports that should be closed.
AnomalyDetector Class:

Monitors network traffic and file access patterns for unusual behavior.
Placeholder methods for monitoring network traffic and file access.
GamingProtection Class:

Protects the system during online gaming by blocking known malicious IPs and ports.
Placeholder method for blocking malicious IPs.
Notes
This script is a high-level blueprint and can be expanded with more detailed implementations, such as integrating specific machine learning models, improving port security checks, and enhancing anomaly detection algorithms.
The normal_access_patterns.csv file should contain data on normal file access patterns to train the Isolation Forest model.
The malware_signatures list should be populated with known malware signatures from a database or file.
This script provides a robust foundation for building a zero-trust system that leverages advanced AI techniques to ensure system security.
