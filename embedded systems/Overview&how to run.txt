🔮 Overview
MagicBox GlyphGuard is a plug-and-play Python application with a GUI for DMA monitoring, memory editing, and embedded communication. It automatically detects USB and serial ports, installs missing dependencies, and includes a safe demo mode for testing without hardware.

⚙️ How to Start
- Install Python 3.8+
Download here if it’s not installed.
- Place All Files in One Folder
Make sure these 5 files are together:
main.py
gui.py
dma.py
watchdog.py
device_interface.py
- Double-Click main.py
Or run from terminal:
python main.py
- ✅ Automatic Setup
- Installs missing libraries like pyserial and pyusb.
- Detects connected USB or serial ports (COM or /dev/ttyUSBx).
- If no device is found, enters safe Demo Mode.

🧪 Using the App (GUI Instructions)
Tab: Bridge Monitor
- View real-time DMA status
- See last hardware event or simulated message
- Monitor watchdog health
Tab: DMA Console
- Click “Start DMA Transfer” to simulate or trigger a memory transfer
- Watch status update automatically
Tab: Memory Editor
- Enter a memory address (e.g. 0x2000)
- Click “Read” to see data at that location
- Click “Write” to send 42 as test data

🔌 USB & Serial Support
- Auto-detects USB devices using pyserial or pyusb
- Works with common chips like FTDI, CP210x, CDC ACM
- Supports Linux (/dev/ttyUSBx, /dev/ttyACMx), Windows (COMx), and macOS (/dev/cu.usbserial)
On Linux, run this to ensure access:

sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER


Then reboot or log out/in.

🧙‍♂️ Demo Mode
No hardware? No problem.
- Safe for testing UI and workflows
- Logs simulated actions in console
- Automatically enabled if no USB/serial device found

🛠️ Troubleshooting
- ❌ “serial has no attribute serial”
→ Rename any file named serial.py in your folder. It conflicts with the pyserial library.
- ❌ “ModuleNotFoundError”
→ main.py installs missing modules. Just re-run after install completes.
- ❌ No GUI appears
→ Ensure tkinter is installed (sudo apt install python3-tk on Linux)
