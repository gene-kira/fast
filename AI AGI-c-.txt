Explanation:
AI_AGI Model:

The AI_AGI class is a more sophisticated neural network that includes layers for visual, auditory, tactile, and biometric inputs.
The decision layer has been expanded to include multiple linear layers with ReLU activations.
Amygdala and Hippocampus layers are also included to handle emotion and memory.
AISystem Class:

This class encapsulates the AI system's functionalities, including moving to a target position, learning from interactions, reflecting on capabilities, updating emotions, and handling real-time inference.
The real_time_inference method collects data from various sensors (visual, auditory, tactile, biometric) and processes it through the AI brain model.
Reinforcement learning is implemented to update the model based on rewards.
User Interaction:

Users can choose between a chat interface or starting real-time inference.
The chat interface allows users to issue commands for movement, learning, reflection, and emotion updates.
Real-time inference continuously collects sensor data, processes it through the AI brain, and makes decisions based on the output.
This setup provides a more advanced and dynamic AI system that can interact with its environment in real-time, learn from interactions, and adapt based on feedback.
