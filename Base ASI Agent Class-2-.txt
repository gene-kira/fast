Enhancements Explained
Agent Interactions:

Each agent can now have interactions with other agents, where the value of one agent can influence another.
The interactions attribute is a dictionary that maps an agent to a list of tuples, each containing another agent and its weight.
Event Handling:

Events are defined as objects that can trigger changes in multiple agents' metrics.
The trigger_events function periodically triggers these events, affecting the system's state.
Complex Metrics:

Agents' metrics now evolve based on both internal drift and external influences from interactions and events.
Logging and Monitoring:

Print statements are used to log changes in agents' metrics and interactions, providing visibility into the system's dynamics.
Running the Script
To run this extended version of the script, simply execute it in a Python environment. The system will initialize, start all agents, and periodically trigger events, simulating more complex behaviors and interactions within the quantum-recursive intelligence ecosystem.
