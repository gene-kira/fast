Explanation of the Script
Logging: The log function writes messages to a specified log file with a timestamp for tracking.

Kernel Module Monitoring:

The monitor_kernel_modules function uses lsmod to list currently loaded kernel modules.
It compares this list with a previously saved state to detect changes.
If new modules are detected, they are logged and can be further inspected (e.g., checked against a whitelist).
Secure Data Storage:

The secure_data_storage function encrypts sensitive data using a simple XOR cipher.
The encrypted data and the key are stored in a secure file.
Rogue Software Detection:

The RogueSoftwareDetector class extends FileSystemEventHandler from the watchdog library to monitor changes in a specified directory.
When a new file is detected, its hash is computed and compared against a list of known good hashes.
If the hash is unknown, the file is quarantined.
Main Function:

Ensures necessary directories exist for logging, state storage, data storage, and quarantine.
Initializes monitoring of kernel modules.
Secures sensitive data (cookies, passwords, personal information).
Sets up file system monitoring using the RogueSoftwareDetector class.
This script provides a comprehensive approach to protecting your system from rogue software, ensuring the integrity of kernel modules, and securing sensitive data.
